**Ingredients**

250ml milk  
25 grams butter  
2 tablespoons flour  
(50g cheese)

**Method**

Whisk fast as the butter melts and the mixture comes to the boil - the flour will disappear and the sauce will begin to thicken. Whisk for 2 minutes while the sauce bubbles and becomes nice & thick.

(Add cheese to make it cheese sauce)
