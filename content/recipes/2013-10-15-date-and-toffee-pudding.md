<!--more tag-->

* 1-2 hours preparation time
* 10 to 30 mins cooking time
* Serves 6-8

<b>Ingredients</b>

* 150ml/5fl oz dark rum
* 1 vanilla pod, split in half and the seeds scraped out
* 250g/9oz chopped dates
* 125g/4½oz butter, softened, plus extra for greasing
* 125g/4½oz soft dark brown sugar
* 3 free-range eggs
* 150g/5½oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
* 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
* 2 bananas, peeled and thinly sliced
* demerara sugar, for dusting

<b>For the toffee sauce</b>

* 175g/6oz demerara sugar
* 1 tbsp golden syrup
* 1 tbsp black treacle
* 170g/5¾oz butter
* 500ml/18fl oz double cream
* pinch salt

<b>Preparation method</b>

1. In a pan bring the rum, 250ml/9fl oz water and the vanilla seeds to
  the boil. Place the dates in a bowl, pour the liquid over the dates and
  leave to soak for an hour.

2. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and flour 6-8
  individual moulds or loaf tins (depending on how many people you
  are serving).

3. Cream the butter and the soft dark brown sugar with an electric
  hand-whisk in a bowl. Add the eggs one at a time, beating between
  each addition. Sift in the flour and bicarbonate of soda. Mix and then
  fold in the date and rum mixture.

4. Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake tins and bake in the oven
  for 12-15 minutes, or until just firm to the touch. Once cooked,
  remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool.

5. For the toffee sauce, put the sugar, syrup, treacle and butter into a
  pan and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and cook, without
  stirring, until all the sugar crystals have dissolved and you have a
  deep-brown caramel. Meanwhile, gently warm the cream in a
  saucepan. Remove the caramel from the heat and carefully add
  one-third of the cream. Once the bubbling has subsided, whisk in the
  remaining cream. Add a pinch of salt and pass through a fine sieve.
  Set aside until needed.

6. Fan the banana slices into circles on top of the cooked puddings.
  Dust with demerara sugar and caramelise with a cooks blowtorch
  (alternatively place the puddings under a very hot grill). Set aside for
  a few minutes to allow the sugar to cool and set, then serve with the
  toffee sauce.
