**Ingredients**

* 4ozs sugar
* 4ozs butter
* 1 heaped tablespoon Golden Syrup
* 2 ozs desiccated coconut
* 3 ozs rolled oats
* 4ozs plain flour
* 2 level teaspoons bicarbonate of soda

**Method**

1. Melt the butter with the sugar and golden syrup then let it bubble for approx 2 minutes.
2. Add the dry ingredients and mix well.
3. Place walnut sized portions (well spaced) on to a well-greased baking sheet, approx 12 to a sheet.
4. Bake in 150C (fan oven) for 17 mins.
5. Leave on baking sheet for 2 minutes then loosen them with a spatula to prevent sticking. Leave to cool on baking sheet.

ENSURE you loosen the biscuits from their baking sheets approx 2 minutes after taking them out of the oven or you will end up with a welded mess!!!))
