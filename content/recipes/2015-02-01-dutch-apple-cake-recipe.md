Put the butter and milk in a saucepan, bring to the boil and stir, still boiling, into the egg and sugar mixture  
Sift the flour and baking powder and fold into the batter carefully, so that there are no lumps of flour  
Pour the mixture into the tin/dish

Sprinkle with the remaining sugar  
Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to Gas 4 [180c/350f] and continue baking for 20/25 mins. or until apple cake is well risen and golden brown  
Mix the cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle on top  
Cut into slices and serve with lightly whipped cream.
