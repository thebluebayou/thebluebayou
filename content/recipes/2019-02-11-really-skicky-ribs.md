**Ingredients**

 * 400ml / 14 fl.oz Tomato Passata
 * 2 garlic cloves, crushed
 * 2 tbsp soy sauce
 * 2 tbsp clear honey
 * 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
 * 1kg / 2lb 4oz pork ribs

**Method**

In a large bowl, mix together the passata, garlic, soy sauce, honey & worcestershire sauce. Add the pork ribs to the bowl & mix well to coat evenly. Tip the ribs and all the sauce into the pressure cooker.

Close the lid, bring up to high pressure and cook for 20 minutes then release the pressure slowly. Scoop the ribs out on to a plate. Put the pan over a medium heat & bubble down to a sticky sauce (about 10 minutes, slightly more!). Toss the ribs back through the sauce and put in a serving dish. Serve with lots of napkins!

Can be reheated by covering the dish with tinfoil & place in the oven at approx. Gas Mark 1 / 2 for 45 minutes...
