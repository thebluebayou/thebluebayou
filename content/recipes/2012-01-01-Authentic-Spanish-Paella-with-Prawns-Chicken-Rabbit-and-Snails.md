  1. Heat some olive oil in a paella pan and sauté the garlic for 1
minute. 

  2. Seal the rabbit and chicken breast quickly. Add the prawns and
mussels and cook for a further minute. 

  3. Add the chopped tomatoes and allow to soften for a minute. 

  4. Sprinkle the rice and stir so all the grains are coated with oil
and begin to become translucent. 

  5. Now stir the saffron, chicken stock, cannellini beans, snails,
frozen broad beans and peas and paprika to taste. Simmer for 15-20
minutes, shaking the pan every so often, but not stirring. 

  6. Five minutes before the end of cooking time add the cherry tomatoes
and season. Serve at once.
