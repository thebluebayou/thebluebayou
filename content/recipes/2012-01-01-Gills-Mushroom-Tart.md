River Cottage head chef Gill Meller's mushrooms, pastry and pancetta, taken from the Hugh's Three Good Things on More4. Hugh's recognised a simple pattern that underpins so many well-loved dishes – that they are little more or less than three good things on a plate and in this series, he pursues that idea, experimenting with different flavours and textures.

<b>Prep time</b>

10 - 15 mins

<b>Cook Time</b>

15 - 20 mins

<b>Servings</b>

2 - 4

<b>Ingredients</b>

* 75g pancetta, chopped into lardons – you can also use Streaky Bacon
* 200-250g large flat chestnut mushrooms, cleaned and chopped
* 1-2 handfuls wild mushrooms, cleaned and chopped (optional)
* sprigs thyme, leaves only
* 250-300g all butter puff pastry
* 1 tbsp parsley leaves, roughly chopped
* Flour to dust
* Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
* Olive oil


<b>Directions</b>

Preheat the oven to 180C Gas Mark 4

 1. Heat a heavy based pan over a medium heat. Fry the pancetta until crisp then remove with a slotted spoon and set to one side. Fry the mushrooms in the pancetta fat in the pan until tender. Add the thyme leaves and a pinch of pepper. Mix together the mushrooms and crisp pancetta. Leave to cool.</p>

 2. Fry the pancetta in a separate pan until cooked through, drain if necessary.

 3. Meanwhile roll the pastry out and place onto a baking tray. Score a rim 2cm wide around the edge of the pastry. Place the cooled mushroom mixture onto the pastry inside the rim and spread out evenly, sprinkle over the parsley.
 4. Transfer to the oven. Cook for 15-20 minutes or until the pastry is cooked through and golden on the outside.
 5. Remove from the oven, slice and serve.
