**Ingredients**

* 2 tbsps caster sugar
* 3 tbsps double cream
* 1 tbsp butter
* Pinch of sea salt flakes

**Method**

Put the sugar and 2 tbsps water in a small heavy bottomed saucepan. Place on a low heat and swirl gently until the sugar has melted. Turn up the heat and let the sugar bubble and caramelise to a nutty brown. Take off the heat and pour in the cream, butter and salt flakes - do this carefully, as it may split. Gently stir together until smooth & glossy.
