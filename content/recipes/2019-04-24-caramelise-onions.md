**Ingredients**

* 25-30g butter
* 2 - 3 large onions (red or white), thinly sliced
* pinch of salt

**Tasty additions**

* 2 tbsp soft brown sugar
* 1-2 tbsp balsamic vinegar

**How to caramelise onions**

1. Heat the oil in a large deep frying pan over a low heat.

2. Add the onions with a generous pinch of salt and cook slowly for around 15-20 mins. Stir occasionally to prevent them from sticking or burning until they become soft and a golden caramel colour.

3. Add the sugar and vinegar to give them that sweet, slightly sharp chutney vibe. Keep cooking on a low heat for another 5 mins, stirring occasionally until the mix is sticky, the sugar has dissolved and the vinegar has reduced.

 4. Your onions are now ready to serve, or to use in a recipe.
