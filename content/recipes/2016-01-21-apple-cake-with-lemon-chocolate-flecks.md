This is the cake I would choose above all others.  It is my mother’s
go-to cake, the one that was always on the kitchen counter.  Although my
wife made a few changes to the recipe, the essence & goodness are
unchanged.

* Makes a 1kg (2lb) loaf cake
* Prep time 20 mins
* Cooking time 50 mins

#### Ingredients

* 2 tbsp whisky
* zest & juice of 1 lemon
* 2 apples (200g once diced skin-on) – I use Pink Lady apples
* 40g bitter chocolate (70% cacao works best here)
* 2 eggs
* 160g caster sugar
* 120g/130ml vegetable oil
* 150g plain flour
* 1½ tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1 tsp ground fennel seeds (I always grind my own)
a pinch of table salt

#### Method

Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas mark 4. 

Butter a 1kg (2lb) loaf tin & line the base & long sides with a sheet of
baking parchment, making sure that there is enough of an overhang to
ease removal of the cake later.

 

Mix the whisky in a bowl with the lemon juice & zest. 

Cut the apples in small cubes (the size of playing dice) & toss them in
the whisky mixture. 

I like to leave the peel on, especially when using the red-skinned
apples, as it looks so pretty in the final result.  Set aside until
later.

Chop the chocolate into slivers like little flecks & set in the fridge
to stay cold. 

In a large bowl, or using a mixer with a whisk attachment, whisk the
eggs with the sugar until they start to puff up & go pale. 

Slowly pour in the oil until it has all been incorporated. 

Get rid of the whisk & use a spatula or wooden spoon to fold in the
flour, baking powder, nutmeg, fennel & salt to a smooth consistency. 
Then fold in the diced apple & whisky mixture & finally fold in the
chilled chocolate flecks.

Transfer the batter to the lined tin & bake for 35mins.  Turn the tin
around for an even bake, then leave for another 15-20 mins.  It should
be bouncy to the touch & the house should be filled with the aroma of
baking apples.  Allow to cool in the tin for at least 15 mins before
devouring.

To me this cake needs no topping at all.  But if you are making it at
teatime & you want to spoil yourself, whip up a small tub of double
cream with a tablespoon of whisky & a tablespoon of icing sugar for a
double treat.
