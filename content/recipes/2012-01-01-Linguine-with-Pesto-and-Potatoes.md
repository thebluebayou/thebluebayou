<b>Ingredients</b>

* 2 maris piper or tohter large potatoes, cut into small cubes
* 60ml/4tbsp olive oil
* 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 1 packet of dried linguine
* salt and pepper
* 150 ml/5¼fl oz vegetable stock
* 15ml/1tbsp mascarpone cheese

<b>For the pesto:</b>

* 2 bunches of watercress, roughly chopped
* 180g/6¼oz almonds, crushed
* 180g/6¼oz parmesan, grated
* juice of one lemon
* 175ml/6¼fl oz olive oil

<b>Method</b>

1. First prepare the pesto. Tip the watercress, almonds, parmesan and
lemon juice into a food processor and blitz, gradually pouring in the
oil. Tip into a bowl, taste and adjust seasoning. If you don't have a
processor or pestle and mortar, simply grind everything in a bowl using
the end of a rolling pin. 

2. Rinse the potato cubes to get rid of any excess starch. Heat the
oil in a frying pan, add the drained cubes and fry until golden brown
and crisp. 

3. Add the chopped garlic and drain over a bowl to catch any juices.

4. Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted water, drain and return to
the pan.

5. Mix the potatoes, pesto, mascarpone and stock in a pan, warm over
a gentle heat. Season.

6. Tip over the pasta and mix well. Serve immediately.
