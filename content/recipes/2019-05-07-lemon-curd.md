**Makes 1 x 200g Jar**

**Ingredients**

* 2 lemons, zest and juice
* 100g caster sugar
* 50g butter
* 2 eggs, beaten

**Method**

Put the lemon zest, juice, sugar and butter in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until the butter has melted. Then, using a small whisk or fork, stir in the beaten egg. Keep gently whisking the mixture over the heat for around 10 mins until thickened like custard.

Pour the cooked curd through a sieve into a clean jug to remove the zest, then pour into sterilised jar(s). Keeps in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
