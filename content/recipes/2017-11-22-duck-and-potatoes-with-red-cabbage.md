The potatoes should be cut very finely here, so that they almost melt into the duck fat. A sharp accompaniment, such as sauerkraut or the pickled cabbage, below, is essential to balance the gloriously duck fat-rich potatoes.

**INGREDIENTS**

*Serves 4*
* baking potatoes 3, large
* duck fat 180g
* rosemary sprigs 4
* duck legs 4

**For the pickled cabbage:**
* red cabbage 400g
* white wine vinegar 125ml
* cider vinegar 100ml
* coriander seed 1 tsp
* soft brown sugar 4 tsp

Set the oven at 175C/gas mark 3. Slice the potatoes as thinly as possible (using a mandolin cutter if you have one). Melt the duck fat in a small pan. Spread 2 tbsp of the duck fat over the base of a roasting tin, then place a layer of sliced potatoes over the surface, season generously with salt, pepper and some of the rosemary leaves, then repeat until all the potatoes are used.

Pickled cabbage is essential for balance

Place the duck legs on top of the potatoes and roast them for 1 hour and 15 minutes, until the duck legs are crisp and the potatoes almost falling apart.

Make the pickle: shred the red cabbage and place it in a stainless steel or heatproof glass bowl. Put the vinegars, coriander seeds and the sugar in a small saucepan, then bring them to the boil. Pour the pickling liquor over the shredded cabbage and toss the mixture gently, then cover and set aside. Leave it overnight if you can, or a good couple of hours if not.
