**Makes 12**

* 200g self-raising flour
* 100g caster sugar
* 100g butter
* 1 egg, lightly beaten
* 4 tbsp strawberry jam

Heat oven to 190°c/170°c Fan/gas 5

**Method**

Rub the flour, sugar and butter together with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. 

Add enough egg to bring the mixture together to form a stiff dough.

Flour your hands and shape the dough into a sausage, about 5cm in diameter. Cut into 2cm slices and place on a large baking sheet, well spaced, as they will spread when baking.

Make a small dent in the middle of each with the end of a wooden spoon, them drop in a teaspoon of jam.

Bake for 10/15 minutes until slightly risen and just golden. Cool on a wire rack.
