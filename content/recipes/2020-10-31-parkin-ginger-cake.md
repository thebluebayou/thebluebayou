**Ingredients**

* 12oz golden syrup
* 6oz butter or baking margarine
* 8oz black treacle
* 13oz oats
* 3 eggs
* 7oz self-raising flour
* 9oz dark brown sugar
* 3 tsp milk
* 3 tsp ginger powder

**Method**

Mix together the golden syrup, butter and black treacle.  
Pop them in the microwave for two minutes to loosen up.  
Pour the mixture into a large bowl of oats, and stir.  
Add the remaining ingredients (eggs, flour, sugar, milk and ginger powder) and mix well.  
Pour into a lined tin and bake on the top shelf at 160Â° for 45 minutes.  
Leave the sponge in the tin to cool, then wrap it in baking paper and foil (still in the tin).  
Store for five days before eating (if you can wait that long!). The cake becomes stickier and softer the longer you leave it.  
Cut into squares. Eat within two weeks.
