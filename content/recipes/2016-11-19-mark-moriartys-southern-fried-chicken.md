Place the thighs on some tinfoil and season with salt. Pour 200ml
vegetable oil onto the tinfoil and seal it up like a package. 

Place in the oven at 120c for 3 hours. Remove and chill in the fridge

Next, remove the skin and bone from the chicken and roll up the meat in
clingfilm like a sausage. Set in fridge

Set up a bread crumbing section; 1 bowl of flour, one of eggwash and one
with breadcrumbs. Add the cayenne pepper and paprika to the breadcrumbs.

Heat a deep fat fryer to 180c.

Remove the cling film from the chicken and place it first in the flour,
followed by the eggwash, followed by the breadcrumbs. Cook in the deep
fat fryer for 3mins until golden.
