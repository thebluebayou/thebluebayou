Servings 6 Calories 392kcal

**Ingredients**

* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cubed
* 1 red pepper diced
* 1 cup stringless snap peas
* 3 cups shredded cabbage or coleslaw mix
* 2 large carrot peeled and shredded
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 1/2 teaspoon minced ginger
* 1-2 pinches red pepper flakes
* 4 cups chicken broth
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup hoisin sauce
* 375 g box whole grain spaghettini pasta
* 2 tablespoons water
* 1 tablespoon cornflour

**Method**

Add oil to a large pot and cook chicken over medium-high heat, just until mostly browned.

Add pepper, peas, cabbage and carrot and cook for 2-3 minutes, until veggies are softened slightly.

Add garlic, ginger, and pepper flakes and cook 1 minute.

Stir in broth, soy sauce and hoisin sauce and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add pasta and reduce heat to medium.

Cook the pasta, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes until pasta is separated (we don't want no clumps!) most of the liquid has been absorbed. Cover and cook for 3-4 more minutes until pasta is al dente or cooked to your preference.Â 

If desired, combine cornflour and water and stir into pasta to thicken sauce. Serve.
