   * 1 tsp dried thyme
   * 1 tsp flaky sea salt
   * 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper

**For the marinade**

   * 200ml/7fl oz low*fat buttermilk
   * 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
   * ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
   * 1 tsp flaky sea salt
   * ½ tsp onion powder
   * ½ tsp dried thyme
   * ½ tsp dried oregano
   * ½ tsp dried sage
   * ¼ tsp white pepper

**For the herby potato salad**

   * 600g/1lb 5oz new potatoes
   * 2 tbsp fat-free Greek-style yoghurt
   - 1 heaped tsp low*fat mayonnaise
   * 1 tsp Dijon mustard
   * 1 tsp white wine vinegar
   * 40g/1½oz cornichon pickles, finely chopped
   * 2 tbsp each finely chopped chives, flatleaf parsley
   * salt and freshly ground black pepper

**Method**

 1. For the marinade, mix the ingredients together in a large bowl, add the
   chicken and coat well. Refrigerate overnight, or for at least four hours.

 2. For the potato salad, place the potatoes into a saucepan of cold water,
   bring to the boil and cook for 20 minutes or until tender; drain and set
   aside to cool. In a small bowl, mix the yoghurt, mayonnaise, mustard and
   wine vinegar together and set aside.

 3. Preheat the oven to its hottest setting and line a large baking tray
   with baking paper.

 4. For the crispy coating, mix all the ingredients together in a shallow
   bowl. Dip the chicken into the mixture and turn to coat well on all sides.
   Place on the lined baking tray. Spray each thigh 4–5 times with the oil.

 5. Cook on the top shelf for 20–30 minutes, or until crispy, browned and
   cooked through. To test, poke the thickest part of the thigh with a skewer,
   the juices should run clear.

 6. Halve the cooled potatoes and place into a serving bowl. Toss with the
   yoghurt mixture, pickles and herbs and season to taste. Serve alongside the
   Southern-style thighs.
