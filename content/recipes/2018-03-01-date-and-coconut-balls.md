One of my go-to recipes that I can make up in bulk and grab before I head out the door is this one for date and coconut balls. You can freeze them as well which is a bonus, but they will keep for a couple of weeks in an airtight container in the fridge. Depends how delicious you find them – ahem...!!

 **Ingredients:**

* 120g dates
* 80g jumbo mixed raisins
* 20g desiccated coconut, plus 2tbsps to coat
* 20g porridge oats
* A tablespoon of coconut oil 

**Method**

Place the dates and raisins in a food processor and pulse until the mixture starts to stick together. Add the coconut, oats and coconut oil and give the mix a quick blast to combine. Take small handfuls of mixture, about 12g each, and roll into balls in the palm of your hands. Spoon 2tbsps desiccated coconut into a bowl and then toss the balls in the mix to cover completely.  Don't stress too much if your measurements aren't exact, so long as they bond well together you'll be fine!
