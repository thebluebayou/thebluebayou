Made with only four ingredients, and ready in just 20 minutes, this cacio e pepe (which literally translates as cheese and pepper), is a brilliant Italian supper that's super simple to make and tastes absolutely divine. See method

**Serves 4**
* 5 mins to prepare and 15 mins to cook
* 546 calories / serving

**Ingredients**

* 400g bucatini or spaghetti    60g butter
* 60g butter
* 1 tbsp freshly ground black pepper
* 100g Parmesan, grated

**Method**

 Cook the pasta until al dent√© in a large pan of boiling salted water following the pack intructions. Drain, reserving 350ml of the cooking water, and set aside.

 Clean out the pan then set over a high heat and add the butter. Once melted add the black pepper and cook, stirring continuously, for 10 secs until fragrant.

Add the cheese and 250ml of the reserved water. Bring to the boil and mix continuously so that the cheese and water come together to form a sauce.

Add the pasta and a pinch of salt. Mix well.

Slowly add the remaining water, stirring continuously, until you have a thick sauce that clings to the pasta (you may not need to use all the water).

Divide between four serving bowls and serve immediately.
