<b>INGREDIENTS</b>

* 200g Shallots
* 4 cloves Garlic
* 150g Arborio Rice
* Sprigs of Thyme
* 1 litre Chicken or Vegetable Stock
* Grated Parmesan
* Salt &amp; Pepper

<b>METHOD</b>

<p>Use a pan that works on the hob AND in the oven.</p>

<p>Peel 200g of Shallots, leaving them whole, then lightly brown then all
over with 4 peeled cloves of garlic in a little butter.</p>

<p>Add 150g arborio rice to the pan, then 4 whole sprigs of thyme and a
litre of chicken or vegetable stock.</p>

<p>Bring to the boil, lay 6 large-ish mushrooms, gill side down, in the
rice, season generously, then transfer to the oven and back at 180c /
gas mark 6 for about an hour. </p>

<p>Serve with grated parmesan.</p>

<b>TIPS</b>

<p>The consistency of the finished dish will depend very much on the whim
of the rice and the stock.  Check regularly toward the end of cooking. 
It it looks too thick then add a little more stock and cover with foil.</p>

<p>Turn the mushrooms over ONCE during cooking, basting them with the stock
as you go.</p>

<b>TWIST</b>

<p>Add a little chopped pancetta to the shallots once they are browned. 
Use a little dry marsala in with the stock.  Include a couple of dried
procini with the rice for a deeper mushroom flavour.</p>
