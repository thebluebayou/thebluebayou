**Cooking time**  
10 to 30 mins

**Serves**  
Serves 4 as a main or 12 as a snack

**Ingredients**

**For the dough**

* 250g/9oz plain flour, sifted, plus extra for dusting
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 150ml/5fl oz tepid water
* 2 tbsp sunflower oil

**For the topping**

* 160g/51/2oz smoked bacon lardons
* 250g/9oz full-fat creme fraiche
* 1 large onion, thinly sliced
* 250g/9oz Emmental or Gruyere, or a mixture, grated
* whole nutmeg, for grating
* salt and freshly ground black pepper

**Method**

1. To make the dough, mix the flour and salt together in a bowl, then add the water and oil and bring together to make a dough. Transfer to a floured work surface and knead well. Roll the dough into two thin rectangles, each measuring around 25cmx28cm/10inx11in.

2. To make the topping, dry fry the bacon lardons in a frying pan until the fat renders out and they are golden-brown. Drain on kitchen paper.

3. Preheat the oven to 230C/210C Fan/Gas 8 and line two large flat baking trays with baking paper. Place the dough rectangles on the trays.

4. Spread the creme fraiche over the dough leaving a little border around the edges. Scatter over the onion, dot with the lardons and sprinkle liberally with Emmental. Season with salt, pepper and a grating of nutmeg.

5. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the base is crisp and the cheese is bubbling. Slide the tarts onto a wooden board and use a pizza cutter to cut them into portions. Serve immediately with drinks or as a light lunch with a green salad.
