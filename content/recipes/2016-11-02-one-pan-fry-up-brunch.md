#### Ingredients: ####

* calorie controlled cooking spray
* 250 g (9 oz) potatoes, peeled and cut into 2cm (3/4 inch) dice
* 3 bacon medallions, chopped
* 150 g (5 Â½ oz) chestnut or button mushrooms, sliced thickly
* 2 medium eggs
* freshly ground black pepper

#### Method ####

Spray a lidded non stick frying pan lightly with the cooking spray.

Stir-fry the potatoes for 3-4 minutes over a high heat until
starting to brown at the edges. Season with pepper, add 3
tablespoons of water and cover the pan. Cook, covered, for 5 minutes
over a lowish heat, stirring once or twice, until the potatoes are
almost cooked through.

Remove the lid, add the bacon and increase the heat under the pan to
medium. Cook for 2 minutes, then add the mushrooms and cook for a
further 2-3 minutes.

Make 2 spaces in the potato mixture and break an egg into each gap.
Cover the pan again and cook gently for 2 minutes or until the eggs
are cooked to your liking. Serve on warmed plates.
