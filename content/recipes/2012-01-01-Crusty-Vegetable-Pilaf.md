Preparation Time 10 to 30 mins 
Cooking Time 30 mins to 1 hr

<b>Ingredients</b>

* 1tsp golden caster sugar 
* 1 large pinch saffron strands 
* 50g/2oz butter 
* 30ml/2tbsp water 
* 450g/1lb basmati rice 
* 30ml/2tbsp vegetable oil 
* 1 large onion 
* 1 red-skin potato (about 250g/9oz) 
* 1 small butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cubed 
* 1 birds eye chilli 
* 1 cinnamon stick 

<b>For the raita:</b> 

* ½ medium cucumber, peeled and chopped roughly 
* leaves from small bunch of coriander and mint 
* 142ml/¼pt natural yogurt 
* ½ lemon, juice only 
* salt and freshly ground black pepper

<b>Method</b>

1. Place the sugar, saffron, half of the butter and water in a ramekin
or teacup and microwave for 1 minute until the butter melts. Set aside
to infuse. 

2. Rinse the rice in a sieve using warm water. Add the rice to a pan
of boiling, salted water and cook for exactly 5 minutes. It should be
nearly done but still slightly hard in the centre. 

3. Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large non-stick casserole
dish. Thinly slice the onion and add to the pan. Cube the potato and add
to the onion along with the butternut squash. Cook for 5 minutes or so
over a high heat until beginning to brown. Chop the chilli, and add to
the pan, including the seeds. Turn off the heat. 

4. Spoon half of the vegetable mixture into a bowl. Top the remaining
vegetables with half of the rice. Drizzle some of the saffron butter
over. Spoon the reserved vegetables back into the pan and then top with
the remainder of the rice. Drizzle over the remaining saffron mixture.
Crumble the cinnamon stick over and place knobs of the remaining 25g/1oz
of butter on top. 

5. Wrap a clean tea towel around the lid and place securely on the pan
to cover tightly. Cook over a low heat for 30 minutes until the rice is
completely tender and a golden crust has formed on the bottom. 

6. For the raita, process the cucumber and herbs in a mini blender or
liquidiser until smooth and watery. Add the yogurt, lemon juice to taste
and season with salt. Process for a few more seconds. Serve the pilaf
warm with the raita as an accompaniment.
