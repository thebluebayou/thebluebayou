#### Ingredients: ####

* 500g new potatoes (peeled)
* 1 white onion
* 150ml Extra Virgin Olive Oil
* 5 / 6 eggs

#### Method: ####

Cut potatoes into thick slices
Chop / slice onion

Heat oil in a LARGE frying pan, add the potatoes & onion and stew
gently, partially covered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally until
the potatoes have softened.

Strain potatoes and onions through a colander into a large bowl (set
strained oil aside).

Beat the eggs separately, then stir into the potatoes.

Heat a little of the strained oil into a smaller (omlette) pan - tip
everything into the pan and cook on a moderate heat, using a spatula to
shape the omlette into a "cushion".

When almost set, invert on a plate and slide back into the pan and cook
for a few more minutes.  Invert twice more, cooking the omlette briefly
each time and pressing the edges to keep the cushion shape.

Slide on to a plate [and cool for 10 minutes before serving.]
