#### For the pastry
* 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
* 100g butter, chilled and diced
* 2 tbsp parmesan, grated
* ½ tsp oregano, finely chopped
* 1 egg yolk
* 2 - 3 tbsp chilled water (may need less)

#### For the filling 

* 2 large eggs + 2 egg yolks
* slices Serrano ham, cut into strips
* 1 red pepper, roasted, skinned and diced
* 100ml crème fraiche
* 150ml Avonmore Cooking Cream
* 120g soft goat’s cheese
* 2 tbsp. chopped chives
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper

#### Method:

* 1.    Preheat the oven to 180C/Fan 160C/Gas 4.
* 2.    Grease a 23cm flan tin with removable base.
* 3.    Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl. Add the butter, parmesan and oregano and rub into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs. 
* 4.    Add the egg yolk and the water and mix to form a dough. Wrap the dough in cling film and allow to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.
* 5.    Roll out the pastry on a floured surface slightly larger than the tin.  Line the tin with the pastry and trim the edges.  Place a circle of baking paper over the pastry and fill with baking beans.
* 6.    Transfer to the oven and bake for 8 minutes. Remove the beans and paper and return to the oven for five minutes.
* 7.    For the filling, place all the ingredients (except for the goat’s cheese) into a large bowl and mix gently.
* 8.    Pour the filling into the pastry case and sprinkle the goat’s cheese on top.
* 9.    Bake the quiche for 20 - 25 minutes, or until the filling is set. Serve warm or cold with a green salad.
