<b>Ingredients</b>

* 2 long sweet peppers
* 8 cherry tomatoes
* 1 clove of garlic, peeled
* 4 tabllespoons of olive oil
* salt &amp; pepper

<b>Preparation Method</b>
<p>Turn the oven to Gas Mark 4 (180c / 350f)</p>
<p>Slice the peppers lengthways and trim any odd edges to form neat
little boat shapes.  Lay them in a fairly large roasting tin facing
upwards. Halve the cherry tomatoes and place them inside the peppers
roughly managing four per boar.  Finely slice the garlic and tuck them
in with the tomatoes and also add any pepper trimmings you have.</p>
<p>Now generously drench the peppers in a good four tablespoons of olive
oil, season and put in the warm over for 40/50 minutes.</p>
