#### Ingredients: ####

* 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
* 2 carrots peeled and finely chopped
* 500g of lean lamb mince
* small handful of fresh thyme
* ½ tbsp. ground cinnamon
* 300ml low salt vegetable stock
* 1 tbsp tomato puree
* large handful of frozen peas
* 2 large potatoes, peeled and diced
* 2 parsnips, peeled and diced
* 2 tbsp butter
* small handful of grated cheddar
* 1-2 tbsp milk
* olive oil

#### Method: ####

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan, then soften the onion and carrots
for a few minutes. When soft, turn up the heat, crumble in the lamb
and brown.

Mix in the cinnamon, add the tomato purée, then fry for a few
minutes.

Pour over the stock and add the thyme, bring to a simmer and cook
for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C.

Steam the potatoes and parsnips for 15-20 mins until tender.


Mash the parsnip and the potatoes together then mix in the cheese
and butter with a splash of milk.

Stir in the frozen peas with mince before portioning out into
ovenproof dishes, pipe on the mash and top with a few more frozen
peas.

The pie can now be chilled and frozen or bake for 20-25 minutes
until the top is starting to colour and the mince is bubbling
through at the edges. Leave to stand for 5 mins before serving.
Storage: Allow to cool for up to 2 hours and then place in your
fridge for about half an hour. Your Pie is now ready to go into the
freezer.

Our Shepards pie can be cooked from frozen, place straight into the
oven and cook for 30-45 minutes until piping hot throughout.
