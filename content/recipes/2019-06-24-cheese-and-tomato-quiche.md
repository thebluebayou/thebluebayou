**Ingredients**

FOR THE CRUST:

* 2 1/8 cups wholewheat flour
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 2 egg yolks keep the egg whites aside for later
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1 cup cheddar cheese grated
* 1 tsp dried mixed herbs

FOR THE QUICHE:

* 8 eggs whisked + the 2 egg whites set aside earlier
* 1 tsp mixed dried herbs
* 1 cup cheddar cheese grated
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 4 large tomatoes sliced into thin rounds

**Instructions**

**TO MAKE THE CRUST**

Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Grease and lightly flour an 11 inch round quiche dish (or pie dish) with sides at least 1.5 inches tall.
Place the flour in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre, pour in the olive oil, egg yolks and milk and stir until combined. Now stir in the grated cheese and mixed herbs. Knead the dough gently 3- 4 times, it should be smooth and not sticky.
Form the dough into a ball and place in the centre of the quiche dish. Press down with your hands until the dough evenly covers the base and up the sides of the dish. Score the crust all over with a fork. Bake for about 15 minutes until going golden. Take out of the oven.

**TO MAKE THE QUICHE**

In a large bowl, stir the dried mixed herbs, cheese, salt and pepper into the whisked eggs.
Arrange the tomato slices in the baked quiche crust in layers (I did 3 layers). Pour the egg mixture over and bake for 35 - 40 minutes until the egg is cooked through.
Allow to cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
