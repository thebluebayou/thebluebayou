* 3 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda

<b>Method:</b>

1. Preheat oven to 220 C gas 7

2. Mix all dry ingredients into a bowl, then rub in butter with your fingers until it resembles a crumble. Then stir in the sugar.

3. Mix the buttermilk and egg together and add to the dry ingredients. Stir all together. The mixture will be a little moist but don’t worry that’s how it is meant to be!

4. Knead the mixture very lightly on a floured surface and then cut out scone shapes with a cutter.

5. Cook on the top shelf for approx 15 minutes.
