**Ingredients...**

* 175g unsalted butter, diced, plus extra for greasing
* 175g light muscovado sugar
* 175g black treacle
* 200ml whole milk
* 2 large free-range eggs, beaten
* 250g plain flour
* 1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
* ½ tsp mixed spice
* 2 tsp ground ginger

**Method**

Preheat the oven to 180°C/fan160°C/gas 4. Grease and line a 1.5kg loaf tin.

Melt together the butter, sugar and treacle, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and stir in the milk. Set aside to cool until lukewarm, then beat in the eggs.

Sift the flour, bicarbonate of soda, spices and a pinch of salt into a large bowl, then make a well in the centre. Pour in the milk mixture and stir to make a smooth batter. Give the bowl a sharp rap on a work surface to get rid of any air bubbles.

Pour the batter into the tin, then bake for 45-50 minutes until a skewer comes out clean. Don’t open the door before 40 minutes has passed as your cake will almost certainly sink in the centre.

Leave to cool in the tin, then turn out. Wrap in baking paper, then cling film. Store overnight or for up to 1 week before serving.
