<b>INGREDIENTS</b>

* 1 kg Floury Potatoes
* 8 rashers of Smoked Streaky Bacon
* 5 tbsp Groundnut or Rapeseed Oil
* 1 tbsp crushed Chilli Flakes
* 1 tbsp Smoked Paprika

<b>for the Dressing</b>

* 250ml Double Cream
* 150g Gorgonzola or Dolcelatte

(any blue cheese will work but milder & sweeter is better)

<b>METHOD</b>

<p>Bring a large pot of water to the boil.  Scrub the potatoes but don't
peel them. Cut each in half lengthways, then into thick wedges. Salt the
boiling water, add the potatoes and cook for 15 minutes until they are
almost tender. Drain and tip into a roasting tin.  Set the oven at 200c
/ gas mark 6.</p>

<p>Cook the bacon in a shallow pan with a little of the oil until very
crisp. Tip into a food processor, add the chilli flakes, remaining oil
and smoked paprika and blits until the mixture resembles very fine
crumbs.</p>

<p>Tip the crumbs over the potato wedges and toss gently to coat. Bake for
an hour or so, until the wedges are crisp and sizzling.</p>

<p>To make the DRESSING, warm the cream in a small, nonstick, saucepan, add
the cubed or crumbled cheese and stir gently until melted. When the
dressing is warm, trickle over the wednes OR serve as a dip.</p>
