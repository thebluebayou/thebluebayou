* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Pinch of Cinammon
* 4 tablespoons brown sugar
* Whipped cream to serve

**Method:**

Preheat oven to 150 degrees C
Place the pudding rice in a ceramic dish
In a saucepan, place the milk, caster sugar and vanilla extract.  Bring to the boil.
Pour the boiling liquid over the rice and cover the ceramic dish with tin foil.
Place in the oven for 100 - 120 minutes.  Remove from the oven after 45 minutes and gently stir to ensure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the dish.
Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for a while.
Once cooled enough to handle, sprinkle with brown sugar and using a kitchen blow torch caramelised until coloured.
