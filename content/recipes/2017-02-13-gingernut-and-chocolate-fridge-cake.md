* 300g dark or milk chocolate, chopped
* 1 tbsp golden syrup
* 250g ginger nut biscuits
* 2 eggs, beaten (make sure they're the freshest you have)
* Cake tin and parchment paper

#### And youâ€™ll need to do these things: ####

1. Line the cake tin with parchment paper.
2. Melt the chocolate and golden syrup in a large heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Meanwhile, crush your biscuits in a plastic bag with a rolling pin.
3. Stir the eggs and crushed biscuits into the melted chocolate and then pour the mixture into the prepared tin, spreading evenly and smoothing the surface with the back of the spoon.
4. Chill in the fridge for a couple of hours until set, or pop in the freezer for about 45 minutes. Remove and slice into pieces.
