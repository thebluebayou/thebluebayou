**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 cup white flour
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 1 1/2 tsp. baking soda, add more if you add a lot of extra ingredients…which I often do!!
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 2 cups brown sugar (Splenda if desired)  (or honey…use less than 2 cups)
* 6 cups oatmeal ( I use Speerville oatmeal)..large flake oatmeal, as natural as you can find.

MIX WELL THEN ADD:  3/4 cup oil and 1 cup of water and I always add 2 tsp. or more of cinnamon.  If the mixture is too dry, just add more water. ( I roll it flat with a rolling pin, in a cookie sheet with sides.  You can also press flat with your fingers…keep wetting your hands to keep the dough from clinging to you fingers!)

**OTHER INGREDIENTS AS DESIRED:**

craisins, raisins, dates, chocolate chips, sliced or slivered or ground almonds,(or any combination of nuts) sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flax meal/seeds, oat bran, wheat bran, peanut butter powder, chia seeds or anything you want or have around!

If adding mashed bananas, decrease some of the water,

if adding peanut butter, decrease some of the oil.  If using honey, take out the brown sugar and decrease  the water….it is a very adjustable recipe, just make it the consistency that you can spread in a pan.

This recipe fills 2 large rimmed baking sheets.  Lay a sheet of parchment paper on the cookie sheet so it covers the bottom and sides.  (if not using the paper, oil the cookie sheet) .  Press into pan.

**METHOD**
BAKE UNTIL GOLDEN......(20-25 MINUTES) AT 375 degrees.

Cut into bars when you take them out of the oven.  Let them cool in the pan.

Once baked, the bars will be like a cookie, will last a long time and can be frozen.  They are OK in a baggy on a hike/ride but will get crumbly.   I have used a vacuum sealer the last few times I made them….and you have seen the results…they are moist  and stay together well.  I did top my last ones with “maple sugar flakes”…but I don’t think they need it (makes for a crunchier topping after baking but that is destroyed by the vacuum sealing)…and I don’t think you could find them in Ireland anyway.
