#### What do I do? ####

Finely dice all your onions  
Chop your chorizo sausage into small cubes, set aside  
Chop your Clonakilty Blackpudding small cubes, set aside.  
Heat a large frying pan until very hot  
Add a splash of olive oil to pan  
Add in onions with knob of butter  
Crush in your garlic clove  
Let the onions and garlic cook down until transparent  
Add in 2 teaspoons of smoked paprika  
Add in your chorizo, cook down for 3 mins until chorizo releases its oils  
Add in your black Pudding  
Cook down for approx 2 mins careful to not let the pan dry out  
Add in your Cider little by little, let it cook down, add in some more.  
Let the stew simmer in the cider juices for approx 5 mins  
Add in your chopped tomatoes and rosemary  
Keep a little water to hand to keep adding if the stew needs is  
Add in your Broad beans or chickpeas  
Turn down the heat and let the stew simmer for 10 mins on medium heat  
Keep looking at the texture and add in a little water if it needs it.  
Wrap yourself up in a cosy blanket & serve with crusty bread and garnish with fresh parsley and cold cider if you fancy it! Bliss!
