<!--start excerpt-->

After what seemed like an eternity we arrived in Girona at 17:30 and lucky old Flo found a parking space on the river 1km from the event office, after picking up my race pack we meet with Marty for a beer and a quick catch-up we arranged to meet at 09:30 on the Pont de Pedra tomorrow.

As normal when we meet the ride had changed from the shop run to a 50 mile spin to the beach with the Ards boys and some north downers . It started out nice and steady through beautiful country very like France,  we stopped for water and a quick coffee and then on to the beach for lunch at a place called Platja d'Aro. During lunch I had a great catchup with Noel Boyce which was very pleasing. The run started to fall apart on the way back when we went on the coast road, very hard and fast.

Didn't go cycling on Friday but Marty came over for a swim and we arranged to meet later for lunch in the Duplex. We got lost on the way back to the van and the heat was extreme 37c we finally got back to the site around 18.00 so we chilled while I got ready for tomorrow. 

We all assembled at the Cathedral as close to the front as possible and at 10:00 we set off flat out 20mph for the first 20km to Banyoles where it was split for those wanting to climb Rococobra here the run settled and groups naturally formed. I dropped in and out of groups all day and Flo saved us all with water and sun cream after one of the water points failed to materialise. Flo and Lotti where waiting at the finish of what was a great days cycling if very hot 37c a weather warning had been issued for heat, instead of our normal rain warnings. 

Sunday and we drove back home using the toll road around Barcelona (â‚¬5.00) well worth it for a nice easy drive home. Only back and it was straight out to the Chinese in Monseratt with John and Mairead to round off a great few days.
