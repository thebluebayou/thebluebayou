<!--start excerpt-->
We meet up with Karen and Lola at Blackrock Castle for a walk, bitterly cold today especially after the mild days we have gotten used to. The only place open for coffee was the Natural Food Bakery and it was doing a roaring trade and we where lucky to get a table outside with the dogs.

Flo and I took some wine and biscuits to the staff in the Bons who looked after Flos mum so well.

Then Karen came round for tea and we heard about her holiday.
