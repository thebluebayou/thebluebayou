Enjoyed a beer over looking the river and watched a pair of Swallows feeding in the roof of the bar.
Walked through Bugarra just to get our bearings for tomorrow.

#### Camping Rio Turia Day 2 ####

Slept late and after breakfast we walked into Bugarra for a coffee and a toastada and then  beer. We walked back along the river Turia only to find the park jammed with people enjoying the river swimming, boating etc.

After dinner we had a drink in the bar Kastigo and an ice cream, Lotti even found a friend to keep her amused. 

#### Camping Rio Turia Day 3 ####

Went on a Flo inspired walk all ok untill we got to the trig point when Flo thought we could cut the walk short as Lotti was hot (she has been diving into any shade she can find). Naturally this turned in to a bit of an epic with us ending up in Pedralba by the river Lotti emeditaly lay down in the river, once in the town we grabbed a coffee and walked back the main road, still a good day some awesome views.

Today we went for a drive after our exertions of yesterday we thought Lotti would prefer to be driven rather than walk. 

Flo needed a post office and the closest one was in Villar del Arzobispo, once the post was taken care of we started looking for a coffee shop after walking through most of the town choices where limited so we stopped in bar los Angeles for a tostada. 

We then drove to a dam at Embalse de Loriguilla where we saw an air rescue Helicopter doing it's thing on the lake once on the dam the views were impressive.

The first bar only had coffee and magdalenas, a quick top up here and a walk round town and we found the Cooperativa Agricola de San Blas where we got some tostadas and beer.

On the way back we stopped a couple of times for Lotti to cool down once she lay down in a river while I through water over her.
