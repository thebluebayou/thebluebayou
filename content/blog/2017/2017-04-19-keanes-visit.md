Collected the troupes in Catado at the Repsol station in brilliant sunshine and Flo brought them home while I drove Blu back.

Monday to my surprise we hit Valencia via the train from Buñol. Our first stop was for chocolate in the Valor cafe where we planned the rest of the day.


Next port of call was the Miguelette and the 207 narrow steps to the top, but it was well worth it for the views of Valencia. 

Time now for lunch and as luck would have it as it is Monday the restaurant we wanted was closed but close by was a very nice place called ????? Where we enjoyed a leisurely meal.

Just time for a quick trip into Cortes Englis and then back to the station and the train to Buñol. 

Tuesday I slipped out for quick cycle while the outers went for a coffee. Then late afternoon we attacked Bonaire Shopping center and finished the day eating in on of the many food concessions wasn't too bad but could have been better. 

Wednesday was a more relaxed day with a very enjoyable Taster Menu in El For cat and to work off some of the calories we walked the Hermitage route. 

Friday and off to the paddy fields. Much to our surprise no water and no rice, we found out they would be flooded later this month. Went to our usual place for coffee and toast. Then we went exploring and we discovered loads of really nice Restaurant's.   Further on we discovered the harbour with lots of boat tours going out on the waterways. This was obviously a major destination for the Spanish as it was busy and getting busier by the minute.

Saturday was a chill out day and I got a cycle in in the morning. La Rambla was our lunch destination  an it was pretty good and very cheap, the to walk off the calories we all walked the Hermitage route again. 

Sunday and unfortunately the Keanes had an early flight to catch so it was an early departure, once again the weather played it's part and they departed in beautiful sunshine. Great week was had by all and it was good for Flo to have some time with her sister.
