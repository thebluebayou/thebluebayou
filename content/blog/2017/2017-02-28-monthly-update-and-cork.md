Not much blogging this month so this is just a catchup.

Sat 4th and we meat up with the Perry's and McCosh's (No Children) in the Lewis Dundonald. We had been warned that there was a Loyalist Disco on at 21:00 but we where not told that as a precursor they where having a band competition so towards the end of our meal two Bands struck up a deafening racket in the small bar, sad to see that not much has really changed in the North, however the food was very good and as is to be expected the crac was mighty, we finished off the evening back at Colin and Beverly's.

Blu was due a service so while that was being done Flo and I finally got round to going for Breakfast, we went to a place in Holywood.

Another Christening in Ballbriggan on Sat 11th, Horrible day heavy rain and very windy but the food after the christening wasn't bad.

Mon 20th Flo and I spent the day in Belfast doing what we normally do the week before Christmas. Just wandered around the town and lunch and a couple of hot whiskies in Murals, after all I did have a bad cold.

Another nasty drive down to Cork stopping in the Applegreen for Lotti's birthday which we marked with a Colin, hard to believe that she is 12.

Anyway Cork was to Clear out the house, a family meal and the months mind service for Florence. Not much to say all went well with just a few Minor irritations. We did manage to catch up with Karen a couple of times which was good even when Lotti pissed in the floor. Got back home on Tuesday evening with a load of junk and hopefully with a few things of value.
