John and I went out for a spin to Dos Aguas via La Chuffa which he hadn't been on before, Flo Went With Amanda and was late back so it was well after 15:00 before we got on the road.

We drove straight to Olmedilla de Alarcon via the N111 rather the A3, a more pleasant route going through the towns although they where more industrial than touresty.  We arrived at the campsite Camping Pantapino around 17:40. The the site was a bit a bit of a shock to the system to say it needed a bit of TLC was an under statement, but on closer Inspection it was fine the toilets were spotlessly clean and the site didn't offically open untill the end of June. We wandered into the town and got a coffee just for something to do then it was time for bed.

Saturday seen us drive to Motilla del Palancar lor supplies and coffee we also got some churros which are really not my thing back to the campsite and we lazed around for the rest of the day. Once it cooled down we took Lotti for a walk.

Sunday we got up and at them quite quickly and went to Alercon to look at the Medieval town and of course the Obligatory Coffee this time with a tostada. We drove home and got back just in time to witness a impressive thunder storm which lasted for nearly 3 hours.
