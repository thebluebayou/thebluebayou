<!--start excerpt-->

We went for a walk to the Hermita but not before finding a bar for a coffee.

The walk up to the Hermita was fairly easy, with exceptional views of the surrounding area although it was hot their was a nice cooling breeze. The walk back down was much easier as we took the road.

This area is known for it climbing and there where two groups doing there thing on the rocks.

We went back into the town to the same bar we where in earlier and enjoyed a lovely lunch. 

To finish off a great day we took Lotti into Flix for an ice cream and a beer. She seems to have gotten over her humpines after the exploding tyre.
