<!--start excerpt-->

All jobs complete by 10:30 van packed off down to Bar la Rambla for a final coffee and cake.
Just to wait for the new guests to arrive at 12:00 which they did spot on time and we're off.

Drove for 1 hour and stopped at a Repsol for a quick bite and a drink also to let the traffic ease.

Pleasant drive to Flix some nice scenery which is new to us along the river E`bere and eventually through Flix and to our casita for the next few weeks.

The house is remote to say the least totally off grid and at the moment patchy Internet and no mobile phone signal interesting to see how we manage.

Going to explore Flix in the morning (17th) and do some necessary shopping.
