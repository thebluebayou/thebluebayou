<!--start excerpt-->

Arriving in Chinon [Camping de L'ile Auger](http://www.camping-chinon.com) around 17:30 to a blistering hot 38c which was a surprise as I expected it to be cooler further north.

Setup in a nice shaded spot, put out the tarp, had tea and then walked round the town and found a caf√© for desert. 

We slept late and after a leisurely breakfast we went for a walk around the old town. Noticeably colder today 18c.

We discovered a nice Creperie for lunch called Creperie du Grand Carroi, and by the time we got back Marty and Pam had arrived, along with a new car. So we spent an enjoyable evening in their van having a natter.

Cool again today but nice and sunny, Marty and I set off around 10:00 cycling anticlockwise in a big loop between the Loire and the Vienne Rivers stopping one in Candes st Martens for a shandy.

Creperie du Grand Carroi was our choice of restaurant to take Pam and Marty to once again the food was simple but very nice.

While Pam and Flo ventured out on a cycle Marty and I went looking at Camper Vans, every configuration imaginable, came away with some good ideas. As the weather looked thunderous we went off in search of the girls, found them just finishing their coffee so we moved across the road and started all over again with coffee and biscuits. 

Finished off the day with a barbecue at the Lyttle's.
