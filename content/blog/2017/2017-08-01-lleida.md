<!--start excerpt-->

Discovered one of the pedals on BC was failing I had to swap it with the BeOne until I could get a replacement, Flo also need tubes for her MTB Lleida was the only place we could be certain to get what we needed, luckily this coincided with free entry to museums on the first Tuesday in the month,so off we went.

We parked in a handy spot an first stop was the bike shop where we got all we needed.

Then we started walking towards the Castle with a quick stop for a coffee. The castle was worth a visit just for the views of the city and it did have some nice paintings on the stone walls.

I had seen a store called Wala on the net and being quite close we went off in search of it. Found it and boy was it an expensive trip but we both got some nice things but i think it was expensive.

While walking Lotti tonight she took off after a badger thankfully she didnâ€™t catch it.
