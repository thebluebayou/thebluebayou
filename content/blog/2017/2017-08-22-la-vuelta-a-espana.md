The King of the hills was in a place called Belltall which was about 1 1/2 hours away. We arrived in plenty of time and after finding the top of the climb and a good place to park we where then able to have lunch in the town, in a Hostel [Cal Feliute](http://www.calfeliuet.com) food was good and the service fast even though the place was packed due to the race passing through. 

Once back at the Alto de Belltall a 3rd cat climb, we got our chairs out and waited for the race. Time passed quickly watching the dozens of Guarda Civil motor cycles and race promotional vehicles passing. Then the helicopters arrived and finally 5 riders in the brake soon followed by the peloton who looked in no hurry.
