<!--start excerpt-->

Called into Thompson Leisure Yesterday just to look, guess what happened when we went back today. 

{{ more }}

After much consideration we decided on a Elddis Autoquest 115 SIG 6469

A much smaller vehicle than we had envisaged at the start of our quest, however this allows us to try a Motor home at at more reasonable price with the potential to upgrade later.

The concern now is if Lotti approves.
