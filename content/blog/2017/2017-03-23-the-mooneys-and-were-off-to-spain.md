Afternoon Tea with May and Carole in the Stormont Hotel nice setting and the company was good, but the Tea left a lot to be desired I think the chief must have served his time in the ship yard.

The Mooney's visited Castle Espie and we all splashed our way round the Lego Trail, with a couple of detours to climb walls fly down a zip line and get stuck in muddy puddles.

Knock Golf Club for a pre Spain night with the Perry's, McCosh's and the Todd,s great night lots of laughs especially at the expense of Karen Todd.

Evening with May and Carole and a lot of wine, then on Sat we went to Marty and Pam's for more of the same, as we won't see them all for sometime.
