Yesterday we reached the half way point of our trip, and a hard old slogg it's been. Saturday was the longest day with busy roads and some showers early on, I could have easily stopped there and then it was just a horrible day, But we Finely reached Wicklow.



Sunday started with heavy rain and strong cross winds, which soon turned into a strong head wind which was to be with us untill we reached Mizzen on Tuesday. Flo was able to meet up with her family in Wexford and go to the christen of Amber, While we battled on to Dungarvan and our only night in a Hotel.

Skibbereen was to be our destination on Monday. Leaving Dungarvan straight in to a head wind a a long steep climb. Cork was a welcome break and lunch at Miread's, then off into the head wind to Skibbereen. Flo meet Mick Brown at our last stop in Clontonakilty and then it was a brutle ride into a raging head wind to Skibbereen, I was very greatful to to others for towing me to the end. Later that night we where to meet up with John and Miread.

Mizen was once again a slogg into a gale force head wind only this time John was there with Noel to do much of the riding. Struggling to stay with the Guys decided in Bantry to drop off and ride from there and over Caha Pass on my own, this proved a good move as I rejoined in Kenmare and we rode on over Molls Gap and into Killarney together. Must say I really enjoyed both Caha Pass and Molls Gap, especially Molls gap as we has a tail wind.

To day is the rest day ,and looking towards the coming days the weather is due to improve with a more favorable wind and warmer temperatures, just kicking around Killarney today taking it easy.
