Well this month was pretty uneventful, started to get some good miles in on the bike after a disastrous December. Dry but cold with little in the way of wind which is always good.

Noel called a meeting about the around Ireland challenge, Daren was there to offer advice on training and nutrition all things we know but choose to forget. I decided to try some long zone two rides both for endurance and weight loss, time will tell how that goes.Â
