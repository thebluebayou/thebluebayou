This month was a bit more eventful than last month. I started to get some serious miles in on the bike and I managed to get my first 100 miler of the year today (28th). However the weight loss is not going to plan so I will have to work on this.

On th 7th Amber Louise O'Brien was born so the following Sat we headed down to Dublin for the usual ooing and aahing, even got to see Barbra breast-feeding!Â  Harry, Kath and Jane arrived just after Tommy rushed off to the bookies.

The following weekend Frank and Kath stayed with us and we had a great time with a lovely meal in Zen a Japanese restaurant in Belfast, we had a super 5 course meal, wish I had remembered to take photo. The Keanes may visit again soon as they ordered covers for conservatory furniture which will be ready in a few weeks.

Had to buy a new wheel for the Fuji not impressed but it was needed, so I also change the front to a fairly new spare I had.

Saturday 26th Flo and I went to the boathouse for our anniversary dinner (18 yrs) the food was lovely, but the venue was a bit cramped, but we still had a good night.Must go out more often.
