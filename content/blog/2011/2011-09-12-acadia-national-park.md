First we went to Thunder Hole then a 4 mile walk in ANC. Lovely warm day blue sky, very hard walking nearly vertical in places more of a scramble. Passed an elderly couple who were having a hard time, little did they know worse was to come. When we returned to the car park we spoke to the range and informed her about them just in case they got into difficulty. Very glad I had my stompers with me as the terrain was difficult, just one blister. Off out to Bar Harbour for a meal and a beer.
