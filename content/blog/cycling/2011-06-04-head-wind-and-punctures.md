MA head wind the whole way to Malin Head but a tail wind back to the ferry at Greencastle. Ran out of hot water but once again Irish hospitality wins out when a local cafe, between Malin town and Malin Head filled the flask for me...  

Lots of photo opportunities at the most northerly point of Ireland.
