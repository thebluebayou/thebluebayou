Bright and early this morning five cyclists left from Newtownards Town Hall on a trip around Ireland, overcast & windy (no change there then !).Â  All well on time, except Martyn, who insisted it was all due to the security alerts in Belfast last night.... yeh yeh
Set off towards Comber and as soon as they had left the square it began to spit with rain - but it did not appear to come to much, unless it is following them...
Will try to keep you updated when I get a wi-fi signal ...
