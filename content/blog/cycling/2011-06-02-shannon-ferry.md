Kept on going in Listowel in an attempt to catch the 10:30 ferry to Killimer but without success, just arrived as it pulled away from the quay ! The summer ferry i e every half hour doesn't start until tomorrow... so tea, coffee and fig rolls all round.  

No so much wind today and warming up well.
