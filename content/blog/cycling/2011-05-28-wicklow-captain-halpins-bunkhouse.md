Arrived in WIcklow at about 5pm and the lads advised just after 6pm - good time for 145 miles! Some incidents to report ... 1stly Peter had a run in with a small dog but not noticed until too late, skilfully avoided.  John did complete the entire day, was feeing better by the time he got to Blackrock - I think the heat assisted.  From Blackrock to Wicklow Noel just took one wrong road and they ended up in Greystones - they tell me its a lovely town and was well worth the visit.  It is believed that Noel's garmin is for sale...  

Went to The Grand Hotel in Wicklow for some pub grub - nice food.  Noel has just returned and had a bowl of cereal - keeps telling us he needs the calories!!!

Lots of yawning going on and a nice cup of tea before bed...looking for an 8 o'clock start tomorrow.
