Up bright & breezy this morning to the sound of a cuckoo outside ... lovely & quiet up here so it made the snoring sound almost calming.

Currently awaiting the arrival of Philip Downie & Matthew McGinley at around 8am for the trip up the Inishowen Peninsula via Letterkenny and until the ferry at Greencastle.
