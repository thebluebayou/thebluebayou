Farewell to Killarney and off towards Galway - another long day, still aiming to be at overnight stop in Galway for 6pm. Heatwave due but has not yet materialised in Kerry so headed off in mizzle - or as they say down here "its a grand soft day" !   

Martyn got taped evidence of snoring in the dorm last night and will play it for anyone who will listen !!!  

Will meet up in Listowel for a quick stop later - J B Keanes country (look him up you heathens...)
