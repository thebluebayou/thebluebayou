Karen's annual trip coincided with some nice weather so we went to Castle Ward.

It was convenient that this was also one of the walks we had to do for Garth's walking tour next September. The place was jumping as there was a Family Fun Day for Halloween.

For Garth's Tour I think we should walk in the other direction.
