Marty tried to find a flatter route today mainly for Rob who was suffering right from the off. We went along the coast after getting lost coming out of  Albufeira, the roads where quite busy around here as it is the main tourist area.

It was my turn for the coffee today and naturally I go stuck for the most expensive of the week â‚¬13.20 in a nice little spot called Carveoiro.

Wales where playing in the World Cup tonight so Rob and Mandy did their own thing while the rest of us went to Casa de Fonte in the old town nice place.
