<!--start excerpt-->
We left Aubeterre-sur-Dronne around 09:30 after coffee and a bun a lovely bright morning for a change but much colder.

We arrive at Urrugne around 14:30 and quickly found the camp-site after a long but enjoyable drive. This was by far the nicest day so far with the temperature rising all the way here. Once we got settled in I showered and shaved, then we took Lotti for a walk and looked for somewhere to eat no luck in that department so we drove up to the nearest super market bought some food and enjoyed our first outdoor meal.

The camp-site was [Camping Larrouleta](http://www.larrouleta.com) a nice site with good facilities would recommend and use again.
