Great walk from the Giants Causeway to Carrick-a-rede with Action Cancer, bus collected us from Carrick-a-rede and dropped us off at the Giants Causeway, we the walked back along the Cliff tops and down to the beach and finally back to Carrick-a-rede. Great weather as well, cool and sunny with a very strong wind.
