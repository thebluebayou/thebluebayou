<!--start excerpt-->

We decide on a rest day as Flo was starting to flag, rightly so as she has done really well easily out lasting Rob.

Watched the WSBK went for a coffee avoided the rain and spent a lazy afternoon watching the World Road Race Championships from the USA, a great win for Peter Sagan. 

Walked back to the old town yet again and had a average meal on the sea front.
