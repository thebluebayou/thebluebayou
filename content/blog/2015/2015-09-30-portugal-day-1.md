Very early flight from the City airport luckily Marty and Pam picked us up. The flight was uneventful and the taxi to the apartments was a great idea and worked very well.

Once we got settled in we took another taxi to collect our hire bikes from BikeLand, the bikes are ok but below average condition.

The 3 of us the went for a spin to get the feel of the bikes and the terrain, we even managed a coffee.

Later Marty's Sister and Brother in law arrived, and we walked to the old to the old town for a meal in Urban Pizza, the whole place was packed.
