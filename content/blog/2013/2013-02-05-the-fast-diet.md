On Friday 1st we started the Fast Diet (worst name ever) which involves fasting for two days a week.

The basics of the diet are that for two days a week you limit your calorie intake to 600 cals, split between breakfast and dinner, you can drink as much calorie
free drink as you want. We chose Mon and Fri to start as we where travelling on these days and food was not readily available, we plan to fast on Mon and Thur from now on.

The fasting was not to bad both days with the second day being easier. I was a bit disappointed with only loosing 1lb but on reflection we had two meals out plus other treats so instead of putting on weight as normal I lost some not a bad result.

We intend to give the diet this month to see how it goes and if we can continue it indefinitely
