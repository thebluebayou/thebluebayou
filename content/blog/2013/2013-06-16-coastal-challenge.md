Once again the club ran the Coast Challenge which saw 950+ cyclists take to the roads around the peninsula.

The atmosphere at this years event was on of the best yet due in no part to the mild dry day and the new sign on area, which seemed to allow people to mingle better. Once again Flo and her sign on team did a great job and everything went very smoothly.

Once things got under way Flo and I went down to Castle Espie for a coffee and to count the money and, sort the on the day entries.
