Visited the Ulster today for an update on my broken Clavicle, managed to get an early appointment (09:15) hoping that we would beat the cues.

 I was called quite quickly and as expected sent to the x-ray department for a current x-ray. Back to the fracture clinic and I was seen by the Dr I was first seen by a few days after my accident and he was please with my progress, and in fact discharged me there and then, but not before I saw a Physo.

Once again the physo was pleased with my progress and gave me some exercises to do at home for strength and mobility.

All in all I can't complain about the treatment and service I received at the Ulster, all appointments were prompt and staff friendly and helpful.
