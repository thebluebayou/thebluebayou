Fogy and damp this morning but no wind to speak of and quite warm, so a good day to tackle the Greenway.

We rode from Achill to Newport via the Great Western Greenway ,easy going with only one steep section at Mullranny. The most interesting part is from Achill to Mullranny, with some nice views of the loughs.
From Mullranny to Newport is very flat open moorland not the best when the wind is blowing. We had coffee in the Blue Bicycle Tea rooms Newport.

According to someone doing a survey on the greenway this August was the busiest yet with 1000 journeys on one day.
