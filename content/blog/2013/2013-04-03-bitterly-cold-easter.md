On Easter Monday Flo and I decided to brave the bitterly cold wind and go for a walk, so we went Crawfordsburn Rd Tullynagardy Rd Ballybarnes Rd Green Mile Clandyboye Leadmines Quarry Rd home.

Great walk but my arm did give me some pain.

On Tuesday Flo cycled while suffered on the Turbo, later we went to Muffler for coffee.
