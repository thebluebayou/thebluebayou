One month and nine fast days later it looks like we will continue with the diet for the far see able future.

I have lost 8lbs so far without too much trouble. The fasting days have become easier and drinking hot water when hungry helps , tea and coffee in moderation.

Cycling is better done on fast days and recovering or a light ride the next day, I have felt slightly week the day after a fast and exercise I need to find out if this is due to the fast or the exercise.

Two problems have arisen 

- I get very cold on fast days
- Tendancy to binge the next day
