Tropical temperatures once again today 22c can't believe it at this time of year. A furley steep start the walk but once we reached the cliff edge the walking was much easier.

We walked from Keem beach up along the cliffs and back down through the valley about 4 miles inall, and once a fantastic day. Looking out over the Atlantic the views where spectacular.

Stopped on the way back for the necessary coffee in Gielty's.

The kite surfing looks to be a bit of a non event, passed by twice now and not much in the way  of activity.
