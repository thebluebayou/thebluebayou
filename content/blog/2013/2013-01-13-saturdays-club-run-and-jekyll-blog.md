A dark damp morning once again, must get lights for tomorrow. Got over to Bangor for my first Peninsula ride with the club this Year and for quite sometime.

{{ more }} 

Managed to get around the Peninsula ok felt a bit tired on some of the drags on the way home, to be expected I suppose considering the head wind we hand on the way down. Once again the riding in the group left a lot to be desired. Weather not looking good for tomorrow.

Played around with the layout for the blog again I think I will strip out all the text formatting and just leave the css for the body Layout.

That seems to have worked, so now I have a separate file for text styling.
