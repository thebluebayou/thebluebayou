 Lovely weather on Sat and I was stuck inside on the turbo not too happy so I decided if Sunday was a nice day I would brave the road on Flo's Mountain Bike.

Sunday arrived and looked promising, so taking the bull by the horns off we set to join the Haw Rd run. All went well no pain etc except for one scare when someone fell off in front of me at a junction.

A quick trip to the Ulster to Visit Colin who has been in since Easter with a badly infected finger, which required an operation and some very strong antibiotics. Luckily he got out on Monday 8th.

Decide to go out on the bike again today (Monday) bastered of a head wind not good on a mountain bike so cut the run short, but still managed 32 miles
