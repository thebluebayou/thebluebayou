Almost perfect conditions tonight for the road race light winds warm and dry. This has to be one of the best marshalled club events I have ever been at thanks in part to the Peninsula Tri club.

Numbers where down on the usual mob that descends on Kirkistown, probably because this was a road course with hills and sharp corners. There where 3 groups on the road Ladies & over 50s, over 40s and senior riders with each group riding to win a club jersey in their respective class.

A good nights competition and a great new format for the Ardill & Patterson.
