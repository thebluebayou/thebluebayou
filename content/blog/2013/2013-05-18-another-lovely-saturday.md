"The race organisers have given in to the inevitable and the North West 200 road races have been abandoned."

Most of the spectators had already given up and left their positions on the circuit.

The grandstand at the start/finish line is empty and there is a great sense of frustration here as we have managed just a couple of laps of action.

Five races were scheduled for today but only two circuits of the Supersport class were completed before that race was red flagged when a rider came off his bike at Church Corner.

It is disappointing, but there is nothing the organisers can do. They put in a year's planning - but it all comes down to the weather on the day
