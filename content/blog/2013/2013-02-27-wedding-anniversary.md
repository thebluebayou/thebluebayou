Twenty years, doesn't time fly and so far so good. May and Carole gave us a voucher at Christmas for Daft Eddys so it only seemed right that we use it towards our anniversary celebrations. Lots of new staff so we where a bit concerned incase the food wasn't up to the usual standard, but it was even better.
