Finally after much procrastinating we got round to having John and Fiona over for a meal.

Flo worked hard to produce a great spread of food, which was devoured along with several bottles of wine.

It was nice to be able to return the compliment for the Christmas dinners we have enjoyed at their house.

It was good catching up and finding out what Mark and Lisa where doing, both seem well on the way to careers of their own.
