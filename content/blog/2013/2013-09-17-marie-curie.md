The weather forecast for Sunday was dire, rain and gale force winds. Flo had already decide to do the Marie Curie on Saturday and I didn't fancy the Ards run on Sunday so the Marie Curie it was.

Quite a few of the Club where going to Downpatrick so I joined them
in Ards and we took the quite back roads to the start at Downpatrick
race course, with Flo driving down and getting an early start on her own with the
intention of me catching her later. At least that was the plan as Flo
forgot her shoes, luckily she remembered in Killyleagh that she hadn't got them and was able to
go back for them. Unfortunately this meant she had to start with
us and was in difficultly right from the start. We managed to get to
the Clough tea stop with the group but left early on our own to give Flo
a head start, the wind turned out to be favourable and the club
never caught us.
