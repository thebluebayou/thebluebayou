 After flo returned from Dublin I Started to cut down the trees in the school.

{{ more }} 

Naturally the school never maintain any thing so it is up to us to cut the trees which are putting the garden into shade in the early afternoon, 3 hours later we had just about finished but decided to wait until tomorrow afternoon so we could see if any more need cutting.

We finished the day off with a Barbie and Beer.
