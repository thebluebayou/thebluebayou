####  Gibson Guitar Showrooms #### 

This was the venue for the evening event, hosted by Lesley Anne Jones with “whispering” Bob Harris and Jenny Boyd (famous for being sister of Patty who was married to George Harrison and having been to India with the Beatles…also being married to Mick Fleetwood – twice?). A nice evening with wine and nibbles

Had a good look around before we caught up with Anne Starr and discussed all sorts.
