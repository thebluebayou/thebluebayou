Garth and I got some good bike rides in, as he was training for Kona in a few weeks time. One good long one and several shorter faster spins.
Flo and Helena did a couple of rides as well one longer one with the quick chicks. 

Didn't do as much cycling as we hoped mainly because we returned home early because of lotti.

All our rides are on Garmin Connect etc.
