<!--start excerpt-->

To break up the drive back to St John we overnighted in Quebec city. As the hotel was a fair bit out we used the bus which was quick and easy. The city is nice and well worth a visit, we found an Italian restaurant with good food and wine.

After dinner we wandered around the city admiring the old buildings, then we found a really nice coffee shop where we waited for the bus back to the hotel.

The weather was miserable for our drive to St John but after 8 hours we finally arrived just before 20:00 and it was still raining.
