<!--start excerpt-->

Got Lotti into jail and on the road by 10:00 which gave us a clear run to Cork. With a Coffee and fuel stop before we hit Dublin it was plain sailing all the way.

We arrived in Cork around 15:30 and meet with Jane Murphy  friend of Flo's to give her a donation to the charity she works for, naturally we did this over coffee.

Next we checked into the hotel and had dinner with Harry, Katherine, Frank and Catherine now we're all set for tomorrow. 

After breakfast in the hotel we spent much of the day wandering around the city and a bit of shopping. I relaxed in the Imperial while Flo and Harry watched a very tight ruby match with Ireland just winning by one point with a last minute drop goal by Johnny Sexton.

We all assembled in Rachel Allen's for the family get together. All in a good night made better when Flo announced that Ned was taking care of the bill.
