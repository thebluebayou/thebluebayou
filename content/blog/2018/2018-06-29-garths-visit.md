Picked up the bike for Garth from Marty's daughter and got it ready for a spin down the Pennisula tomorrow.
Making the best of a bad thing Garth and I got some great bike rides in and the weather was out of this world.

Tue 3rd and Carole's Funeral took place in Kirkwoods with the Cremation at Roselawn then La Mon for something to eat an nice day but very sad.

Thur 5th took Garth back to the airport for his flight home, enjoyed his company looking to seeing him and Helena in September.
