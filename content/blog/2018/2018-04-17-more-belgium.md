<!--start excerpt-->

Spending our last night in Holland, at an Aire on the Maas in a town called Blerick just beside Venlo. Interesting place overlooking a marina and major cargo port, watching barges being loaded and unload.

**Tuesday  17th**

Arrived in Aywaille about 13:00 and got settled in the Campsite. Flo and I went and did some shopping then we collected Lotti and did  more shopping. After tea we all walked into Aywaille and discovered the route for tomorrow race, so we returned to Eddy and planed our viewing of La Flèche Wallonne for both Wednesday and Sunday.

**Wednesday 18th**

Blazing sunshine for the Flèche Wallonne, so hot we had to move to the shade while waiting for the race. Small breakaway group then the main peloton all passed in a flash.

Spent the rest of the day cleaning bikes and fitting chains.

**Friday 20th**

To day I rode up Le Redoute part of both Flèche Wallonne and liege Baston Liege hard enough climb Not overly long but when your on it it seems to go on for ever.

**Saturday 21st**

Spotted a dipper on the river just opposite the van just before tea tonight. 

**Sunday 22nd**

Getting ready to watch Liege Baston Liege pass the camp site, when we'll head over to La Redoute at least that's the plan at the moment. 

Well it all worked out as planned watch the race pass the campsite early this morning then we enjoyed a coffee. We gathered up Lotti and dandered over to La Redoute got a great spot 1km from the top, sat back watching the world go by waiting for the race. The remains of the break made it over the top and it seemed the race was well and truly on. The break was caught soon after and Bob Jungles run out the winner.

A part from the race today has been shit fixed puncture number 2, pump does not work, air cartridge broke, and PC won't detect SD Cards so we can't look at our photos. 

**Tuesday 24th**

Flo and I cycled to the Mur de Huy on a cool grey morning thankfully it warmed up later on. The climb was short but very steep in places, the ride out was nice but up hill and into a stiff head wind.

Luckily we got a really good guide Gaetan Plean who was quite informative about track activities and very funny. Enjoyed our tour of an iconic race track, very surprised at the elevation changes massive. We also looked at lots of very expensive McLaren cars.
