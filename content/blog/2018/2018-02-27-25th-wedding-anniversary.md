<!--start excerpt-->

The plan at the moment is to get the 16:30 bus to Lagan Side, and have a pint in the Duke of York, then dander up to Botanic for or meal in Sakura.

So our plan all came together rather well. Got to the Duke of York and we must have been the only locals, spoke with a Dutch couple who where doing the Game of Thrones thing. Then we walked to the Sakura where the food was good and the service excellent. We then enjoyed a coffee in Clements and caught the 10:00 bus home.

Still can't believe we are married for so long, strange thinking back to my youth and what I thought then.
