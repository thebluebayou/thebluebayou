<!--start excerpt-->

Only just here in St John and Garth has us running around like headless chickens, first to Earl's to collect a tent then to Cosco's for snacks etc for the Ultra run at the Res on Sunday.

The we sourced a flapper repair kit for the downstairs toilet, and reinstall windows on the troublesome all in one PC.

Sunday was a 05:45 start so we could set-up for Ultra Race which we only just managed as the first runners arrived to sign on. The event was very successful with people travelling significant distance to compete.

**Wed 29th Kennebecasis River**

Flo and I went Canoeing on the Kennebecasis River and it was just as good as when we where last here back in July 2016, this time we seen much more wildlife Bald Eagles, Osprey, Mink, Herons and lots of fish. All the exercise has given us a great appetite, as luck would have it Kredl's corner was on our way to the Hill climb so we took advantage and stuffed our faces. Next stop was the Hill Climb / Time Trial, once again well supported on not a great night very warm and windy everything went well.

**Fri 31st St Andrews**

Garth & Helena wanted a sea water swim before Garth’s Ironman in Kona, Katy’s Cove was just the spot, while they went swimming flo and I took the hard option and went shopping. Then we all met up for lunch at the Niger Reef Tea House to end another great day.

**Wed 1st Cape Enrage**

We are here to see if G & H can put on some kind of race, first thoughts are that it's not really suitable with the most likely being the zip wire and the repelling. Still its a great spot with lots of potential just needing some money and thought.

**Lotti**

Karen contacted us with news that Lotti has been hit by a car on Tue 4th and is to have surgery Friday, having spoken to both Karen and the Vet we have decided to return home and flights are booked. 

Sat 8th arrived in Dublin in good time and straight off to Cork, we made good time and were able to visit Lotti who was doing very well. The vet arranged for us to meet with Shane Guerin on Monday to confirm Lottis status.

Good news today Lotti is doing well and able to travel. We have taken her to Karen's for tonight and on Home tomorrow.
