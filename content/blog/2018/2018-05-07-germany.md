**Ladenburg**

Our plan was to stay in an aire by a camping shop while the shop was excellent the aire wasn't so we moved on to Ladenburg.

We stayed in an aire here about 1.5km from the town center. Wandered into the town for a beer and to check the bus times to Heidelberg for tomorrow.

We made a cock up with the bus but we got their eventually. Heidelberg is a nice city built in a Valley by a river with a castle high on a hill over looking both.

It's a University town with lots of tourests many of them Chinese.

Nice to see in a city this size that the bycycle Is the main mode of transport.Once again we have been lucky with the weather Writing this after tea sitting outside in the sun.
