<!--start excerpt-->

Took Blu down to Quinton Bay for a shake down run since we completed her internal build earlier in the week.

All went well gas worked so we had tea and coffee, just a matter of being organised with the necessary gear for our travels I think it will require quite a few trips to sort everything out.

Played around with the mythtv it did work, likely need a better aerial or change the tuner.

Lotti also enjoyed the trip as she got ball play and a swim.
