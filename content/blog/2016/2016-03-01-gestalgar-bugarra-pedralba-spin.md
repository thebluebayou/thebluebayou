Nice ride through Chiva to Gestalgar quite hilly through a forest to Gestalgar which is nestled in a valley right at the foot of some big mountians. The road was closed, luckly there was a nice dirversion to Bugarra which seemed to be more a collection of factories, Pedralba on the other hand looks like it would be worth a visit on foot.

Today was once again very windy and I ended up with a cross head wind all the way home, and the roads where draggy and wide open no shelter.
