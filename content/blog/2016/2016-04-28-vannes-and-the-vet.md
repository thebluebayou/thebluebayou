<!--start excerpt-->
Both Flo and I spent the night running to the toilet luckily we where parked right beside the toilets and they where heated.

Feeling a bit off we all set off to the vet, a bit different from home only one vet no receptionist, anyway all went well and Lotti can now travel.

From the vet we walked in the center of Vannes turns out it is quite a big town, with an older pedestrian part and a more modern but much busier area. Wwe grabbed a bag of chips down at the harbour before doing the town then a coffee before we headed back to Blu, the walk back was nice and we stopped and watched while a boat was moved in the boat yard.

The campsite had a nice restaurant which we made good use of as we where starting to feel a good bit better.
