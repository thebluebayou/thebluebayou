<!--start excerpt-->

A quick stop in Empuriabrava to suss out Flo's Brothers Spanish bolt hole, nice spot very built up hectic in high season.
Arrived in Carcassone around lunchtime, and being in France parking was piss easy and close to the Old Town.

We walked around the Medevile town just what you would expect narrow streets and lots of shops although many where local crafts.

Then we followed the walking trail into the modern town and this was also very nice with a canal running through it, in the square we grabbed a spot of lunch and the back to Blu to contine on to Castres.

It took longer than we thought to get to Castres, arriving at the campsite Camping Gourjade around 19:00. The camp is once again very nice and situate in a massive public park. We all walked into town for coffee and crepes in Brasserie de Lâ€™Europe.
