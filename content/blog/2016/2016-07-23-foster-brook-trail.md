<!--start excerpt-->
Helena drove us to Fundy National Park and we meet up with Darrell and his
walking group and we walked the Foster Brook Trail.

Very warm today but nice in the forest. The trail was moderate with just the one steep section in the
middle, and we enjoyed lunch on the Wolf Point river bank.

After the walk we went into Alma for a coffee in the Octopus Coffee shop and
drove back via Suffolk.
