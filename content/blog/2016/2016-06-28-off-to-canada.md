<!--start excerpt-->

We got the Bus from Cork to the Airport last night and stayed in the Premier Inn as we have an early flight in the morning.

First we flew Dublin to St John's, Newfoundland and connect to Halifax Nova Scotia the flights all went well and we where pleasantly surprised by the heat in St John's.

Garth and Helena picked us up from Halifax and we arrived in Saint Johns NB around 19:00 the weather on the way down was lovely until we reached G&H and it clouded over but still very warm and humid.

So let the fun begin.
