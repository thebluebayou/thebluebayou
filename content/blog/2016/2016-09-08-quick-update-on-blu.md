Not a lot posted about Blu in recent weeks / months, due mainly to being away on holiday in Canada with Garth & Helana. Now that we have been back for few weeks and Flo got her act together and we ordered a kitchen from Evodesign, which took around two weeks to arrive meaning another delay.

The flat pack arrived last Thursday and we started to assemble it over the course of the weekend. Some problems with some work tops de laminating which held us up quite a lot while we re glued them. Tuesday we spent moving all the wiring to suit the new units and Wednesday was spent drilling holes for switches and sockets. Today with the units finally assembled we got them fitted into Blu, and wired most of the 12v electrics, just need to get some cable to finish the 240v sockets.
