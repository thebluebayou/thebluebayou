<!--start excerpt-->

A Foggy drive to Blacks Harbour and a longer Foggy boat ride to Grand Manan.

After an early start we were all gasping for coffee when the boat docked we made a bee line for the first coffee shop we could find, the aromas when we opened the door where promising but we where told that this was a Roasting House and they couldn't sell coffee, so back on the road we went.

We ended up at the far end of the Island and no coffee, but it was decided we need a walk so a short very slippy walk was undertaken but was soon abandoned as it was too slippy under foot.

Driving back we stopped at Food for Thought for some very nice sandwiches although what we ordered and what we got where two different things.

We then explored some of the fascinating Light House and because the weather was so poor we changed to an earlier boat home.
