<!--start excerpt-->
Very cold last night with some heavy rain, fortunately it dried up for breakfast but it was only about 6c, on the road nice and early with our first stop Mont St Michel forecast not great but fingers crossed.

Mont st Michel is obviously a massive tourist attraction the car park alone is ginormous. Once parked it was nice to discover the cost also included return transport along the elevated causeway. Thankfully we are here in the off season place was buzzing and not that big I preferred Carcassonne just had a nicer feel about it.

Stopped a few minutes down the road for a coffee and laughed at an American lamenting the size (or lack) of the coffee cups. Moving on we realised the Tour Grand Depart starts here on the 2nd July.

Checked in at the campsite Camping de Golf in Saint Jean de la Riviera, again dogging the showers while walking Lotti we went to the Hotel des Isles, very upmarket but once again Lotti was welcome.
