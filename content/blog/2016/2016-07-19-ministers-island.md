<!--start excerpt-->
After doing some quick jobs down town and grabbing a quick coffee in Second Cup G
& H pick us up and we headed of to Ministers Island.

Almost perfect timing saw us having to wait for about 5 minutes for the tide to
clear the causeway before we could cross to the island. Once across we parked
and started the walk around the islands perimeter, 2.5 hours and 4.5 miles
later we finished. Lovely walk through the trees with great views of mainland.

Needing coffee we headed to Saint Stephen and got great coffee and Fudge in
Worth a Wiggle, and then back home.
