Another beautiful morning here in Altury warm and sunny, just finishing off the packing and almost ready to go.

Quite a long drive today and of course the weather is looking great, made good time to Barcelona and then we got diverted because of road works and lost a lot of time driving through the City, we finally got on to the coast road and back on track. Not a very nice place wall to wall hotels with a duel carriageway and a rail track between them and the beach not my idea of a holiday destination.

As time was marching on we grabbed a Burger King walked Lotti and headed of to Sant Pere Pescador, Girona. We arrive around 20:15 and had a spot of bother finding the camp site, Camping Riu but we found it and it was fine. Got ouselves sorted and went for a coffee to walk Lotti already noticing the cold.
