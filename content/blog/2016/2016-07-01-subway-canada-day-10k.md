We stopped of at Gina and Errols this morning and collect a nice Kona CX bike for me to ride while we are here.

Then it's off to Grand Bay-Westfiels for the Canada Day 10 mile road race, Garth running in the 10k race which he won even though Alex Coffin messed up the finish which apparently was Garth's fault. The weather for the race was perfect warm and sunny with no wind.

After the prize giving we all went for an ice cream and a spin around the peninsula and back home for Connor's Birthday party.
