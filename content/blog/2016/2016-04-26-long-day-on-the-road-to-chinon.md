<!--start excerpt-->
Up early this morning and on the road straight after breakfast, a bit damp so no point in hanging around. Heavy rain and heavy traffic so we diverted off the main road and took a slightly longer route but much nicer arrived in Chinon 18:30.

Usual routine find optimum place for Blu then into Chinon for a quick look and something to eat. Found a nice Restaurant which accepted Lotti and we enjoyed a lovely meal and 1/2 bottle of wine.
