**Somethings are the same the World over.**

Masses of people every where, but all very good natured. Tonnes of work to produce the comic figures which will be burned on Saturday night. Many of the figures have political over tones much of which goes over our heads, but some doesn't same problems the world over.

We also managed to arrive in the Plaça de l'Ajuntament for Mascletà Pirotècnia Zarzoso basically a big fireworks display with the emphasis on noise lots of noise, once again loads of people and all very good natured.
