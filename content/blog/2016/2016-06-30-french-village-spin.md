Adjusted Helena's bike and Garth and I parked in the Irving Station and we headed off on the roads around French Village.

The temperature increased up to 29c but the humidity was the real killer not very nice. At one point a guy on a motor bike complement us on our speed and cornering ability. Hard roads but a lovely place, would make a nice place to build if we decide to move here.
