<!--start excerpt-->

Very cold last night but got a good nights sleep in fact we got up at 9:30 so after breakfast a walk around Chinon.

Chinon is a lovely place with the campsite located on the banks of the Loire and one can look up to the town and once in the town you can look down over the campsite. Lotti enjoyed a trip in an elevator.

Easy drive to Vannes stopping for a coffee on the way, tonights stop is Le Conteau a large site in fact the largest so far. We stopped on the way at a Carrefour bought dinner and a bottle of wine.

After dinner we endured a long walk to find Lotti's vet where she is going to tomorrow for her rabies injection to allow her back home.
