<!--start excerpt-->
Flo Left 15 mins before me but I caught her too soon so we changed our coffee stop to El Dolcet in Montserrat. After the coffee we each headed off on own to finish the spin. This was the hottest day of our visit so far with the Garmin showing 31c , unfortunately the wind was savage but the down hill tail wind bits where brill. Flo done really well considering the wind and hills, following most of my route all but the cv-50.
