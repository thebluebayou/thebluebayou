Awoke to one of the better morning on our travels to the boat lovely and bright and not so cold a nice way to start our last day on the Continent.

Barneville - Caterat on the way we stopped in a garden center and bought a large Mailbox as you do. On in to the port we got a coffee and admired the scenery lovely spot with lots going on, all types of boats on the water or just about to be launched.

Followed the Route des Caps around the coast to Le Puix and a fantastic Tackle shop where I acquired my 3rd Opinel of the trip this one for Oysters. To kill some time in Cherbourg we went for a McFlurry then off to the port for the boat. Flo checked Lotti in and all was ok so just waiting to board.
