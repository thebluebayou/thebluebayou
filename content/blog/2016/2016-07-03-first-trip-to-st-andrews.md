Quick out and back spin with Garth to Cape Spencer, while Helena and Flo did the same route, another lovely morning, quite impressed with the Kona.

Then we drove down to Saint Andrews for G & H to have a meeting with Tressa, Flo and I wandered round the town sorting things for next week and the Challenge event.
