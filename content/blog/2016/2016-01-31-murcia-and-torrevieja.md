<!--start excerpt-->
We spent a few day down in Torrevieja with Sam McMinn and then Gerry Kearney it meant we had to return to Turis and then go back down to Gerry's but it was worth it as we got some great rides in, and I was able to take Flo and Gerry to the Airport.

Most of Sam runs went from Bar Studzs and involved the Amigos del Ciclismo.

We had a couple of nice rides with this group to Orihuela a nice city which Flo and I went back to while waiting to go to the Airport.

Gerry was a good host and took me on a couple of hill runs one of which the Tour of Murcia climbed on Saturday Santuario de la Fuensanta. We also walked around the Mar Menor
