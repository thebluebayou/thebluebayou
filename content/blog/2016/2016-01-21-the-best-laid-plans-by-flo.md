This morning Keith & myself set off to go to on our first joint cycle (apart from the transportation to Turis early on back in December – and that’s enough about that!!!) with a trip back to Tous.

Started off, having walked Lotti, with a beautiful blue sky, warm and little breeze at about 10:30am. Got to L’Alcudia and went off route (well, I did do it on the laptop without having been on the roads before !) and onto a dirt track when I almost ran into the back of Keith who had stopped suddenly.  Unfortunately, he had a broken spoke in his back wheel. So we had to turn around and head back to Big Bikes in Carlet, which was fortunately only about 3k from where the incident occurred. Lucky we had been in there yesterday …  We thought we might just be able to buy a replacement spoke but no, they replaced it within 10 minutes at a cost of €7, good service and a nice shop (had to look around while waiting, of course).

As we were too late to get to Tous before 2pm (when siesta starts and lunch finishes…) we went back to the park at the back of Carlet, near the primary school. Lovely little cafe / restaurant called El Parc – many pensioners in for a €7 menu del dia, 2 courses & coffee – sounds like a good deal. We, though, had coffee and tart and both were lovely

and a mere €5 the lot !

In for a loo before setting off again and it would appear that the cafe / restaurant is park of a local community centre. Community does seem to be important here, pity we have lost it at home.
