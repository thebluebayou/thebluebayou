Flo Cycle today with coffee in Alborache, quite hilly again with longish drags and a nasty little bit around Bunyol, left too late and once again very hot, but the road surfaces are second to none if only they where like this at home.
Altury , LLombai, Real, Montroy, Monserrat, Godelleta, Bunyol, Alborache, Turis and Altury.

Around 21:00 we went into Turis for the last night of the Jazz in the Amfiteatre, tonight it was a local school with their teachers. It turns out to be surprisingly good with one young boy particularly good.
