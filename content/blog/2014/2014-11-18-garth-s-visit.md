It's hard to know where to start as we packed so much in. Naturally enough our first cycle was postponed due to rain which wasn't forecast and it rained heavily for most of the day.

So it was Sunday 19th before we got out for 50 miles around the Peninsula.

Our second ride was in continuous rain and while quite windy it was very mild, but we still managed 38 miles.

Luckily the weather improved on Wednesday as we had arranged with Marty to do his famous Boat Run. We just arrived as the Strangford ferry was docking, perfect timing once again. Once in Portaferry coffee was called for and as I know Marty likes Delicious thats where we went.

Thursday and shopping in Belfast with the Linen Hall Library our coffee venue. Spent ages in Waterstones looking and buying books. A quick spin home for Lotti then back to pickup May and Carole for lunch in the Secret Garden, the food was great and we arranged a trip to the Chinese at the hack for Sunday.

Friday and Flo was back in form and looking to get out on her bike, we went to Ballyhackamore via the Comber Greenway, and the obligatory coffee in Neils Hill. Our return route took in Greengraves Rd and Ballybarnes.

We also walked the Van Morrison Trail which was mildly interesting.

Saturday Garth and I managed to dodge the rain around Ballynahinch and did 65 miles with loads of hills, and surprise surprise coffee in Jay's Crossgar. Flo and I also went to Elane's 40th Birthday party and I spent most of the evening fixing printers.

We decided on a recovery ride, and the Haw Rd run fitted the bill especially as it had a coffee stop. Enjoyed a really nice meal with May and Carole in the Mandarin Palace.

Monday turned out another poor day perfect for bike washing before returning Garth's to Marty. Flo arranged for us to see the Imagination Game in the QFT great film well worth watching, then we dashed home to return Garth's bike to Marty.
