<!--start excerpt-->
Out for a spin with Flo again today. Trying to find the road from Turis to Chiva was like looking for a needle in a haystack, finaly Flo found it and we had shorter reverse of Sundays run, with Coffee in Monserrat.

Spent the evening watching a distant thunder storm from the pool, no sound just the light show.
Today's route was Altury, Turis, Godelleta, Monserrat, Montroy, Real and Turis.
