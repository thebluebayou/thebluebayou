Got up early this morning to cycle in the cooler morning air, very over cast actually looked like it would rain. Change of direction went Turis Altury Alborache Dos Aguas Truis the descents where better this direction.

Got back early and while the others went out I enjoyed a leisurely shower.

Early evening and we went to the paddy fields for Paella in Raco de les Eres then back to La Font for our desert.
