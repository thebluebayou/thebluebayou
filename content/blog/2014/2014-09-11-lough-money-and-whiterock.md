Last time we came here it was very busy with fishermen all around the Lough shore, this time there where 3 fishermen, which for all intents and purposes we had the whole Lough to ourselves.

We soon discovered that we could not walk all the way around going anticlockwise, so doubled back on ourselves and went clockwise, and where able to walk all of the west side and on to the lane to the road. Flo thinks there may be away via another lane which would cut out the road.
