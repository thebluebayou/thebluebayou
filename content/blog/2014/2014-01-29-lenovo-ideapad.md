I have had my [Lenovo](http://www.lenovo.com/uk/en/) for nearly a month now and I am very pleased with it. It is much larger than my previous Sony CS1.

This computer is probably the fastest that I have ever owned with an Intel® Core™ i7-4700MQ @ 2.40GHz processor and 12GB ram, it came with Windows 8 which I upgraded to 8.1 before I installed any software, and I also removed all the crapware, of which there was plenty. The keyboard in nice to use but the trackpad is a disaster with the buttons integrated into the pad and it is offset left of center which is just wrong.

The screen is ok with colors slightly muted hopefully this won't have a negative impact when using Lightroom or watching video.

The main reason for the purchase is to run Virtual Machines to test different OS and software/configurations. So far it has not disappointed, I have installed [Debian][d] (Jessie/testing) and [Gentoo][g] both run as if fully installed, I gave both machines 4GB ram, [Gentoo][g] got 4 cores to help with compiling while [Debian][d] got 2 both run well, in fact the [Gentoo][g] machine run faster than the kzone server.
