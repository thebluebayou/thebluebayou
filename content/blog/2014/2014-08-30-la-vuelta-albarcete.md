We left Altury around 10:00 and arrived in Albarcete about 13:00, we took a longer route but it was worth it as the scenery was lovely and once again the roads dead quite.

We drove into the centre of Albarcete and parked in an underground car park about 500mts from the stage finish.

After getting orientated we bought some Vuelta goodies and went to get something to eat in a nearby bar, we took up position on the 50 meter line and watched the race unfold on the big screen while collecting loads of pruck from the publicity caravan. The stage was very hard due to strong cross wind and was won by Nasa Buhama of FDJ.

While walking around Flo seen Dan Martin getting into a team car and was able to get a photo, he sure look tired, we also got the stage winner.
