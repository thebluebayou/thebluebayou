 Last day of our holidays so I added a couple of loops together and ended up with a decent run once again it was very warm and sunny.

My bottom bracket started making noise again so new bearings needed on return home. A quick shower and I started packing up BC for the return home.

We went into Monseratt for our evening meal and watched the children playing with their parents in the town square, made for an enjoyable evening.

Turis,Bunol,Mascastre, Dos Agus, Llombai, Real, Altury.
