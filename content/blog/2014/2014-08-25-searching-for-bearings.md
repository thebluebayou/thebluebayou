<!--start excerpt-->
After much messing around and the use of a translator we could only get an 10m Allen key and no bearings. We rang John back in Cork to see if he could get bearings brought by one of his fiends. However when I got home and removed the cranks the bearing where fine. so I rebuild and the noise was gone.

I went for a test ride and the bike was fine, no creaking, but I have never experienced wind like it unbelievably hot very strange for me.

My next problem was the route planning software on the Garmin, it would appear to work but not very well.

Mairead got herself and John job interviews, hers is for Monday and Johns is for 5th September.
