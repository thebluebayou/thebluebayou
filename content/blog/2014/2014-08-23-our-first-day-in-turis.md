<!--start excerpt-->
 After last nights drinking and eating I managed to sleep to 09:00, so after
breakfast I built up my bike and adjusted Flo's so they would be ready for
tomorrow.

I helped Mairead and Flo finish cleaning the pool , and then we went to Turis
for a coffee and to buy food for tomorrow. Back home and I showered an relaxed
until we go for a walk later.

A nice 3 mile walk before tea to get the body moving. Ate a massive Sharon fruit I picked up off the ground, so sweet and juicy.
