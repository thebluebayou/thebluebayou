After The Cooley Challenge we had promised John that we would go to Ballyhoura, after a dismal drive down in pouring rain on friday, Saturday turned out a lovely bright sunny day. 21 miles and two and a half hours later we had compleated the white run, lots of flowing single track on well maintained paths. Probably the best day I have ever had on a Mountain bike.
