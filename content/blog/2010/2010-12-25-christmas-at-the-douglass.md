Being the coldest Winter on record in Northern Ireland, and Christmas Day tempatures of -12 it was touch and go if we would be able to get to Fiona and John's for our Lunch. Luckly the roads where clear of snow and we arrived in god time.

Once again the whole family put on a great spread of food and drink and a great day was had by all. It was good to see Kathleen, Fiona, Mark and Lisa once again.
