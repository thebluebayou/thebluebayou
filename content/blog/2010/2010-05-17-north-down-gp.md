**North Down GP**

My First open road race since the Ards 3 day back in July 2006. A good race on a tricky rolling circuit, 7 laps some in heavy rain. All in all a good day finishing in the main group and staying at the front for as long as I could, unfortunately I had nothing left for the gallop at the end.
