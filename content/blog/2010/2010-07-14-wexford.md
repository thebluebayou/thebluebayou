Spent some of our 12th weekend in the now traditional Kilraine. This year Richard And Yuk were also staying with their little girl Hannah. Lotti and Hannah spent most of the time avoiding each other, except in lottis case when there was the chance of Hannah dropping food.

Monday was a nice day so off we all went to the Waterford & Suir Valley Railway, and a 50 minute (12km) journey in the above train.
