Many weeks hard work by lots of club members paid off as this years event was one of the best yet. Superb weather saw close to 800 riders taking part. For the first time since we started running the event I was able to take photos at will, with most people happy to pose for me. The atmosphere at Barr Hall was great with everyone taking time to have lunch in the warm sunshine.
