Drove up on friday afternoon traffic was light, which gave us time to admire the sunset. Fantastic as it was it was a precursor to the wild weather forecast for late Friday night and Saturday.

Arrived at the Magherabuoy House Hotel around 16:30 and relaxed in our rooms, then went for a drink in the bar and our comp meal in the hotel restaurant. An early night ready for tomorrow.

Woke to a strong wind and some heavy showers, off to Coleraine we went for some shopping and coffee. The Diamond in Coleraine is great but the market was disappointing but we did see the Commonwealth Games Tourch being paraded through the Diamond. After coffee we drove to Bushmills Distillery had a look around the gift shop where Flo bought some stuff, we decided against coffe as the coffee shop wasn't that inviting looking, luckily we found a nice coffe shop in Bushmills.

Off we went to Dunluce Castle walked round, it took some photos, watched the video and headed back to Portrush. Drove around the town a decide where to go for the evening, decided on the Harbour Bar. Flo went for a walk and then back to the hotel.

Out we went to the Harbour Bar waited 1 hour for a table only to find it was a bench so out we went, and discovered a nice Italian restaurant where we had a lovely meal.

Sunday and a late breakfast, checkout and up to Balintoy Harbour then drove the coastal route to Torhead and eventually Castel Espie for coffee and home.
