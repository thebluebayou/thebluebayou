 This evening turned out to be quite busy, first I had an interview with Tesco in Newtownards and then more importantly Flo's Birthday dinner at Daft Eddys. 

 The interview seemed to go well even though I had to wait for one of the interviewers. Needless to say I was declined a couple of weeks later.

The weather cleared up a little bit when we got to Daft Eddys and was very calm with a lovely sunset over the bay. As to be expected the food was great, and the company wasn't bad either.
