John and Mairead came up from Cork to ride the hilly 125, the weather on the day was shite with heavy rain for the first hour and a half. No way would I have started if they hadn't come up. It was warm which was about the best you could say, anyway I quite enjoyed the day. 

After showers etc. we went to the Parlour at the Old Cross for tea, first time here and it was grand.
