Spoke to Garth this after noon and he has book a Flight on Thursday to
Heathrow arriving at 20:30 he will be staying in the Nova hotel and driving to
Birmingham on Friday morning. Must ring him on Sat unless he get me first.

Did my Bowbell route this morning very windy once again but it turned out
not as nasty as it could have been. Talked to Noel about the Rider Support
Program and he was of the same opinion as myself, in that it was a bit
elitist, and most of the club would not benefit from the program.
