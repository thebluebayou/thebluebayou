I rode the Rás Loughguile today, the race started in lovely sunshine but we where soon meet with driving hail and when we went over Ora it snowed.I got away on the second lap when the first of the hail started and managed to stay away for a whole lap, I was nearly caught but the hail returned and the bunch eased off. On the Climb of Ora a smal group got away and because of the filthy conditions they managed to stay away to the finish, several crashes on the descent saw some riders face down in the bog.
