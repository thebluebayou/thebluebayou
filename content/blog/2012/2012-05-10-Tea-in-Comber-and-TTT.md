After helping May and Carole move to there new house in Dundonald we took them to Tea in Comber.We went to a new place called the Sugarcane, good company but a pretty poor meal cold starters and tinned soup, not some where we will recommend.

Tuesday night took us to Woodgreen for a 25 mile TTT only problem half the team never showed just myself and Noel.
