With a little bit of messing around I got Steve Kemp's Chronicle up and
running on kzone. This could be a nice Blog/Diary project.

I Have been working with the two Colins down in Carnalea Golf Club for most
of the week, hopefully today was the finish.

Entered some of the club members into the database for Flo this
afternoon.
