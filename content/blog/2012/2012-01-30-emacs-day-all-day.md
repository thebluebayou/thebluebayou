Started to get a feel for emacs to day, and it did take nearly all day. Finding information is not a problem finding current and relevant info can be a real challenge. How ever I did get the colour theme working and formatted the date in the calendar for European formatting. I even added the Moto GP and World Super Bike dates. Now all I have to do is put it all all together and start org mode. 

On another note Garth rang to day, all the work at the house has been done so he hopes to fly home tomorrow or Wednesday at the latest.
