Need some supplies and coffee, The Village Bakery provided the first of many coffee stops and I wanted a look round the hardware store which turned out to be what we expected a mix of the old and new. 

We drove to Newport and around Furnace lake and back to Achill for lunch. I thought we could walk lotti round the shore and back up a river on to the road but the beginning of the river proved illusive so we gave up and took Lotti back the way we came, leaving her in the house we walked back along the road to the top of the river and then followed it to the sea, not an easy walk good job we left Lotti home and of course the rain returned and we got soaked but it was good fun.
