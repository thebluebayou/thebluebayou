Easter Saturday was a lovely day and I enjoyed the club run to Portaferry,
nice and fast on the way down helped by the brisk tail wind. On the way back
everyone was quite relaxed with few changes if any, my legs where still stiff
from Thursday so I opted not to go over the Brae.

Sunday and Monday where very unproductive with Paris Roubaix and then
MotoGP both of which where compelling viewing, Boonen's win in Roubaix was
fantastic as was lorenzo's in Qatar.

Tuesday was Lotti walking and not spending money on a new bike day. We took
Lotti to the green mile for her walk and we went to Crawfordsburn for coffee.
Then up to Belfast for a tour of the bike shops, Halfords, Slanes and Chain
Reaction none of which inspired me to part with the cash for a new steed, much
to Flo's relief. Back home and Â£300 later saw parts to  refurb the Fuji being
ordered from Winstanley Bikes, know all I have to decide is wither or not to
get a paint job.

Enjoyed Easter a lot this year no pressure, all I have to do now is keep in
shape and loose some more weight.
