Did Harry's run this morning on the Fixie and then went to Decathlon with Flo and Karen. Spent a fortune but I did get a nice coat.

Colin and bev had their Haloween party on Saturday night, the crac was mighty and it was good to catch up with everyone and to see the children growing up.

Sunday was a more relaxed day, went to Castle Espie for morning coffee and read the paper, the in the evening we went to the Parlour for tea and a few pints.
