First race of the year, Phoenix GP At Nutts Corner all went very well felt good and I wasn't tested at all until the end tuff drag up to the finish managed to hang on for 8th place. Not a hard course just hope I can continue in the same vain in the coming races. Great day for the club as the two Noels took first and second in the over 50's race while Matty won the A3 race.

Daft Eddies on Monday Night for our 19th Wedding Anniversary meal, food was great as usual and the Guinness went down well. Also the good company helped.
