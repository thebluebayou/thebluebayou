Updated the members services section of the website today, as normal ended
up doing it twice first time to prove that I did'nt like what I had and then
to improve on that.

For what ever reason I thought I would try and get a script to upload this
blog to fastmail using NCFTPP found a nice wee bash script then spent several
hours trying to get it working, eventually success and it seemed to work well.
Tomorrow morning we will see if the cron job works!
