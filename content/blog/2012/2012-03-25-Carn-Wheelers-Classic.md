Fantastic day today 22c in March, raced in shorts and bare arms. Good course and a well run race. Clifford Blayney won the A4 race and I finished 7th very happy. Huge field 80 riders and the usual morons who can't ride there bikes. Ended in a bunch sprint pushing and shoving all over the place. Flo and Lotti where my support team and Flo got some great Photos and even managed to feed me
