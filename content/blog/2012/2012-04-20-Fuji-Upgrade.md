Fitted new forks, brakes & cables and a front mech to the Fuji. I also put new FSA compact bars on the Red Cannondale and my Felt, I have not been able to try the Felt yet but the Cannondale is fantastic, I can ride on the drops for long periods with out any problems, so I have ordered a set for the Fuji.

I had just finished all this when Flo complained about a clicking noise coming from the rear of Coppi, Further examination showed the rear wheel was nackered, hub and drive side cones gone, so I ordered a wheel from Chain Reaction, my next job when we get back from Cork on Monday.
