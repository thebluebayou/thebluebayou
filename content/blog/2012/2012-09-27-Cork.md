Brendan Kirk rang last night to see if I would go for a cycle today so we arranged to go out at 08:00 which suites me as we where going to Cork this afternoon, got back about 11:30 and after a quick shower off we went. On The way we callen in to the Java Republic shop and narurally had a coffe and bought some to bring home.   

Friday Afternoon we went in to Cork City and Flo enquired about upgrading her camera to a 7D but later advice reccommened a D60 so we will have to see, I bought a new diary for next year.

 Flo was on her photo course today and the weather was fantastic, I had a quite day in Tramore Lane , walked Lotti and cleaned the back patio.

 Traveled home to day (Sunday)crap weather but good to be home
