Spoke to Garth this afternoon, he was clearing out the Helena's house in Birmingham, and had already made several trips to the dump. Sara had been round with a friend who bought the Cooker, Washing Machine and I think the Fridge. Garth already board managed a run as well. Hopefully he will be over Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.

Started to learn EMACS today worked through the basic manual and have made more progress than in the past, so far it has been relatively straight forward (I hope). This has been written using emacs, the main problem is remembering the commands, there are many. My main aim is to use org-mod but I feel that is a long ways off.
