Castlebar for coffee today just for a change of scenery Cafe Rua great spot nice coffee and chocolate cake, walked round the town and Flo debated buying a pair of boots but decided against

 Westport was the next port of call and the West Bar for Lunch, unfortunatly Flo's back was giving her a lot of trouble so it was a quick walk round town and back to the cottage to pack fro home on Sat
