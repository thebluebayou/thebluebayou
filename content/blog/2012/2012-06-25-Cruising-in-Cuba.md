SENSE OF PLACE â€“ Cruising in Cuba: The National Highway in Cuba has many
stretches where you will not see another car for miles. Then when you do see
one, it is an old classic like this 1950s Buick, which looks at home on the
open road with the Cuban landscape of fields and mountains in the distance.
