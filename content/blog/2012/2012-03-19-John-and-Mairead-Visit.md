St Patricks was on Sat so as it is a holiday down south John and Mairea where able to come up for the weekend. John and I managed to get out on our bikes every day as the weather was unseasonably good mild and dry.

 On sat we rode the club run to Portaferry, I was caught short and stopped but I was unable to catch the group, luckily they stopped for coffee and I was able to join them for the rest of the ride. 

 Saturday evening and we went to Romas for a meal and a few pints lovely meal and good company what more do you need.

 Sunday morning and we all headed out on our bikes, with John and I meeting Flo and Mairead in Mountsteward and all coming back to ards with the Club.

With the weather staying good John and myself went off on a hilly ride to Carryduf, Saintfield, Shrigley and  Whitrock stopping for coffee in Daft Eddys with the two girls then back to Ards
