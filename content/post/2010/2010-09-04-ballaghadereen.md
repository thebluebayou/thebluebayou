On Tuesday 31st August we travelled to Ballaghadereen Co Roscommon and the Abbeyfield hotel for 3 nights, on the drive down the weather was fantastic, stopping for coffee in Carrick-on-Shannon, on the way in to Ballaghadereen I spotted a car parts shop which we visited the next day to get a replacement Ariel for the car. On arrival in Ballaghadereen and after checking in to the hotel we went out for a short drive to see what was available for food, but we decided to eat in the hotel bar.

**Boyle**

Wednesday was another fine day with the temperature in the twentys. After much map reading and debating we set of on our bikes going clockwise round Lough Gara and Lough Key stopping for coffee in Lough Key Forest Park, then through Boyle and back to the hotel. A great day out on quite roads and summer weather for a change.

Thursday and it was off to sunny Sligo. It's nice to see that many Irish towns have kept their own identy, Sligo being a good example and Henry Lyons being a good old fashioned business which is still carries up to dateÂ  stock with a great Cafe. Lots of shops for Flo to root round and she found a birthday present for Jasmin. We used our included meal and dinned in the hotel restaurant and then went down town for pint.

**On our way Home**

Friday was our last day of this trip, after a late breakfast we headed North to Clones, Antrim and finaly home. Another fine day sunny day and warm enough for us to stop on the river Erne for lunch. After getting home we went to the kennels and collected Lotti.
