On the 5th October we flew to Alicante and collected a battered hire for the drive to Valencia, as one would expect the weather was fabulous. The drive was uneventfull and we arrived at John & Mairead's house mid after noon, and it didn't take us long to get the wine on the go.

With glass in hand we enjoyed the weather for the rest of the day.

The next day we travelled into Valencia for some shopping and sight seeing. Many hours where spent wandering around the shops, and Flo bought a pair of cycling shoes.

A trip the station for some photos, and then the market for much needed Coffee and cake.

We enjoyed a lovely lunch in La Fonte a busy restaurent in Touris â‚¬7.50 for the menu del dia well worth it.

On Friday we drove back to Alicante and stayed in a Holiday Inn for our flight the next morning. That night we went to a new Japanese Buffet called the Wok, after a shakey start the meal turned out to be exclent with a hugh choice of food, so even cooked while you watched.
