Marty and myself set off from Newtownards at 7:30 and cycled to Meelmore Lodge about 40 miles , where we meet up with Flo. After a quick change of clothing it was off up the trassey track to the hare's gap where we regrouped, and following the Brandy Pad we walked round Slieve Commedagh. Turning left we headed to the mourne wall and the valley between Donard and Commedagh. We then followed th Mourne Wall over Commedagh and Back to the Hare's gap and finaly back to Meelmore Lodge, covering about 9.5 miles in total.

The walk took us about 5 hours in total and was quite hard, luckly the weather was fairly good with only one shower of note and that was on the way back to the car, and we dried quickly in the strong wind.
